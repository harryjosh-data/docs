It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Fatty liver disease is a condition in which fat builds up in your liver. There are two main types:</p> <ul> <li>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)</li> <li>Alcoholic fatty liver disease, also called alcoholic steatohepatitis</li> </ul> <h3>What is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)?</h3> <p>NAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds:</p> <ul> <li>Simple fatty liver, in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications.</li> <li>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the liver. NASH may lead to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cirrhosis.html\">cirrhosis</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/livercancer.html\">liver cancer</a>.</li> </ul> <h3>What is alcoholic fatty liver disease?</h3> <p>Alcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of the alcohol you drink, so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking it down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells, promote inflammation, and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that you drink, the more you damage your liver. Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for fatty liver disease?</h3> <p>Researchers do not know the cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). They do know that it is more common in people who</p> <ul> <li>Have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype2.html\">type 2 diabetes</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/prediabetes.html\">prediabetes</a></li> <li>Have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html\">obesity</a></li> <li>Are middle aged or older (although children can also get it)</li> <li>Are Hispanic, followed by non-Hispanic whites. It is less common in African Americans.</li> <li>Have high levels of fats in the blood, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html\">cholesterol</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/triglycerides.html\">triglycerides</a></li> <li>Have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressure.html\">high blood pressure</a></li> <li>Take certain drugs, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html\">corticosteroids</a> and some cancer drugs</li> <li>Have certain <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/metabolicdisorders.html\">metabolic disorders</a>, including <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/metabolicsyndrome.html\">metabolic syndrome</a></li> <li>Have rapid weight loss</li> <li>Have certain infections, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitisc.html\">hepatitis C</a></li> <li>Have been exposed to some toxins</li> </ul> <p>NAFLD affects about 25 percent of people in the world. As the rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol are rising in the United States, so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the United States.</p> <p>Alcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy drinkers, especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time. The risk is higher for heavy drinkers who are women, have obesity, or have certain genetic mutations.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of fatty liver disease?</h3> <p>Both NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease are usually silent diseases with few or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may feel tired or have discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen.</p> <h3>How is fatty liver disease diagnosed?</h3> <p>Because there are often no symptoms, it is not easy to find fatty liver disease. Your doctor may suspect that you have it if you get abnormal results on liver tests that you had for other reasons. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will use</p> <ul> <li>Your medical history</li> <li>A physical exam</li> <li>Various tests, including blood and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html\">imaging tests</a>, and sometimes a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/biopsy.html\">biopsy</a></li> </ul> <p>As part of the medical history, your doctor will ask about your alcohol use, to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which medicines you take, to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD.</p> <p>During the physical exam, your doctor will examine your body and check your weight and height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease, such as</p> <ul> <li>An enlarged liver</li> <li>Signs of cirrhosis, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html\">jaundice</a>, a condition that causes your skin and whites of your eyes to turn yellow</li> </ul> <p>You will likely have blood tests, including liver function tests and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodcounttests.html\">blood count tests</a>. In some cases you may also have imaging tests, like those that check for fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis, which is scarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, and to check how bad the liver damage is.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for fatty liver disease?</h3> <p>Doctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss can reduce fat in the liver, inflammation, and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain medicine is the cause of your NAFLD, you should stop taking that medicine. But check with your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine gradually, and you might need to switch to another medicine instead.</p> <p>There are no medicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a certain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help, but more studies are needed.</p> <p>The most important part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If you need help doing that, you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol recovery program. There are also medicines that can help, either by reducing your cravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol.</p> <p>Both alcoholic fatty liver disease and one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to cirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines, operations, and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure, you may need a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/livertransplantation.html\">liver transplant</a>.</p> <h3>What are some lifestyle changes that can help with fatty liver disease?</h3> <p>If you have any of the types of fatty liver disease, there are some lifestyle changes that can help:</p> <ul> <li>Eat a healthy diet, limiting salt and sugar, plus eating lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</li> <li>Get vaccinations for hepatitis <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitisa.html\">A</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitisb.html\">B</a>, the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/flushot.html\">flu</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pneumococcalinfections.html\">pneumococcal disease</a>. If you get hepatitis A or B along with fatty liver, it is more likely to lead to liver failure. People with chronic liver disease are more likely to get infections, so the other two vaccinations are also important.</li> <li>Get regular <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/exerciseandphysicalfitness.html\">exercise</a>, which can help you lose weight and reduce fat in the liver</li> <li>Talk with your doctor before using <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/dietarysupplements.html\">dietary supplements</a>, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/vitamins.html\">vitamins</a>, or any <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/complementaryandintegrativemedicine.html\">complementary or alternative medicines or medical practices</a>. Some <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/herbalmedicine.html\">herbal remedies</a> can damage your liver.</li> </ul>"}, {"instruction": "Your identity is a doctor, kindly provide answers to the medical questions with consideration of the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Old age?", "output": "The process of growing old and showing the effects of time."}, {"instruction": "Being a doctor, your task is to answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Fresh Tissue?", "output": "Tissue that is not frozen or embedded in preservatives"}, {"instruction": "As a medical professional, your responsibility is to address the medical questions using the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Pulmonary Function Test Decreased?", "output": "A decrease in any of the parameters used to measure the mechanical function of the lungs and upper airway."}, {"instruction": "Given your background as a doctor, please provide your insight in addressing the medical questions based on the patient's account.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Food and Beverages?", "output": "Edible or potable substances."}, {"instruction": "Given your profession as a doctor, please provide responses to the medical questions using the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Coughing?", "output": "A sudden, audible expulsion of air from the lungs through a partially closed glottis, preceded by inhalation.

Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into Th2 cells, a process that is promoted by interleukin 4 (IL-4). Activated Th2 cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies in response to IL-4 and IL-13. IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Eotaxin then stimulates the selective recruitment of eosinophils from the airway microvessels into the lung tissue. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation."}, {"instruction": "Given your profession as a doctor, please provide responses to the medical questions using the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Healed?", "output": "Recovered, restored to healthy condition by natural processes, e.g. by scar formation; freed from illness or injury."}, {"instruction": "In your capacity as a doctor, it is expected that you answer the medical questions relying on the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Truncal obesity?", "output": "Obesity in which excess fat is accumulated primarily in the area of the abdomen."}, {"instruction": "As a healthcare professional, please evaluate the patient's description and offer your expertise in answering the medical questions.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Antifungal Agents?", "output": "Substances that destroy fungi by suppressing their ability to grow or reproduce.

They activate macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and these effector cells may kill islet beta-cells by one or both of two types of mechanisms: (1) direct interactions of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells with a beta-cell autoantigen-MHC-I complex on the beta-cell, and (2) non-specific inflammatory mediators, such as free radicals/oxidants and cytokines (IL-1, TNFalpha, TNFbeta, IFNgamma)."}, {"instruction": "Given your profession as a doctor, please provide responses to the medical questions using the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Liver calculus?", "output": "The presence of solitary or multiple stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts."}, {"instruction": "Your role as a doctor requires you to answer the medical questions taking into account the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Ice Bags?", "output": "A container filled with frozen material that retains its temperature for an extended period."}, {"instruction": "Being a doctor, your task is to answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Chemical acidity/alkalinity?", "output": "the hydrogen ion concentration or pH"}, {"instruction": "You're a doctor, kindly address the medical queries according to the patient's account.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Response (communication)?", "output": "A statement (either spoken or written) that is made in reply to a question, request, criticism, or accusation."}, {"instruction": "In your capacity as a doctor, it is expected that you answer the medical questions relying on the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Mood swings?", "output": "A condition of frequent mood changes associated with excessive emotional reactions."}, {"instruction": "Given your background as a doctor, please provide your insight in addressing the medical questions based on the patient's account.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Normal Observation Interpretation?", "output": "<p>The result or observation value is within the reference range or expected norm (as defined for the respective test procedure).</p><p>[Note: Applies to numeric or non-numeric results.]</p>"}, {"instruction": "You're a doctor, kindly address the medical queries according to the patient's account.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Crusted scabies?", "output": "A rare, severe form of scabies that is associated with immunosuppression.

The only apparent significant difference is their reference to use in protocols for exclusion of study subjects. These concepts/codes were proposed by RCRIM for use in the CTLaboratory message. They were submitted and approved in the November 2005 Harmonization cycle in proposal \"030103C_VOCAB_RCRIM_l_quade_RCRIM Obs Interp_20051028154455\". However, this proposal was not fully implemented in the vocabulary. The proposal recommended creation of the x_ClinicalResearchExclusion domain in ObservationInterpretation with a value set including those three concepts/codes, but there is no subdomain of that name or equivalent with a binding to either of the value sets that contain these concepts/codes. Members of the OO WG have recently attempted to contact members of RCRIM regarding these concepts, both by email and at the recent WGM in Atlanta, without response. It is felt by OO that the best course of action to take at this time is to add this comprehensive Open Issue rather than deprecate these three concepts at this time, until further discussion is held.</p>"}, {"instruction": "In your capacity as a doctor, it is expected that you answer the medical questions relying on the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Vaccines, Combined?", "output": "Two or more vaccines in a single dosage form."}, {"instruction": "Given your profession as a doctor, please provide responses to the medical questions using the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of CDISC SDTM Evaluator Terminology?", "output": "Terminology associated with the evaluator codelist of the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM)."}, {"instruction": "Being a doctor, your task is to answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Teaspoon Dosing Unit?", "output": "A unit of volume used in pharmacy and equal to 5 milliliters."}, {"instruction": "Your identity is a doctor, kindly provide answers to the medical questions with consideration of the patient's description.\nExplain the definition of the medical term.", "input": "What is the meaning of Cannabis?", "output": "The plant genus in the Cannabaceae plant family, Urticales order, Hamamelidae subclass.
