A systolic BP measuring less than 90mmHg and/ or diastolic BP of less than 60mmHg is considered hypotension. A difference of 20 mmHg systolic BP and 10 mmHg diastolic BP is considered orthostatic hypotension (OH). Orthostatic hypotension is the most common type of hypotension, and neurogenic hypotension is demonstrated among 1/3rd of the individuals with OH. A decrease in blood pressure can be life-threatening in conditions such as anaphylaxis and addisonian crisis, and requires prompt treatment. It is important to access the possibility of head injury in a patient with syncope due to hypotension. ECG is an important and essential component of the evaluation of hypotension. Shock requires prompt management with fluids and vasopressors. For other causes of hypotension, identifying the cause and treatment is the best strategy.

He named it protein C because it was the third protein (\"peak C\") that eluted from a DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromotograph. Seegers was, at the time, searching for vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors undetected by clotting assays, which measure global clotting function. Soon after this, Seegers recognised Stenflo's discovery was identical with his own. : 6822 Activated protein C was discovered later that year,  and in 1977 it was first recognised that APC inactivates Factor V a. : 2382  In 1980, Vehar and Davie discovered that APC also inactivates Factor VIII a,  and soon after, Protein S was recognised as a cofactor by Walker.  In 1982, a family study by Griffin et al. first associated protein C deficiency with symptoms of venous thrombosis.  Homozygous protein C deficiency and the consequent serious health effects were described in 1984 by several scientists. : 1214 cDNA cloning of protein C was first performed in 1984 by Beckmann et al. which produced a map of the gene responsible for producing protein C in the liver.  In 1987 a seminal experiment was performed (Taylor et al.) whereby it was demonstrated that activated protein C prevented coagulopathy and death in baboons infused with lethal concentrations of E. coli. : 2382 \nIn 1993, a heritable resistance to APC was detected by Dahlb\u00e4ck et al. and associated with familial thrombophilia.  In 1994, the relatively common genetic mutation that produces Factor V Leiden was noted (Bertina et al.).  Two years later, Gla-domainless APC was imaged at a resolution of 2.8 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms. \u03b1\u203a  Beginning with the PROWESS clinical trial of 2001,  it was recognised that many of the symptoms of sepsis may be ameliorated by infusion of APC, and mortality rates of septic patients may be significantly decreased. : 3161,6 Near the end of that year, Drotrecogin alfa (activated), a recombinant human activated protein C, became the first drug approved by the U.S. FDA for treating severe sepsis.

These include the glucocorticoids which are critical for regulation of blood sugar and the immune system, as well as response to physiological stress, the mineralcorticoid aldosterone, which regulates blood pressure and kidney function, and certain sex hormones. Both benign and malignant tumors of the adrenal cortex may produce steroid hormones, with important clinical consequences.\nAdrenocortical adenomas, or adrenocortical \"nodules\", are small, benign tumors of the adrenal cortex which are extremely common (present in 1-10% of persons at autopsy). The clinical significance of these neoplasms is twofold. First, they have been detected as incidental findings with increasing frequency in recent years, due to the increasing use of CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging in a variety of medical settings. This can result in expensive additional testing and invasive procedures to rule out the slight possibility of an early adrenocortical carcinoma. Second, a minority of adrenocortical adenomas are \"functional\", meaning that they produce glucocorticoids, mineralcorticoids, and/or sex steroids, resulting in endocrine disorders such as Cushing's syndrome, Conn's syndrome (hyperaldosteronism), virilization of females, or feminization of males. Functional adrenocortical adenomas are surgically curable.\nMain article: Adrenocortical carcinoma\nAdrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, highly aggressive cancer of adrenal cortical cells, which may occur in children or adults. ACC's may be \"functional\", producing steroid hormones and consequent endocrine dysfunction similar to that seen in many adrenocortical adenomas, but many are not. Due to their location deep in the retroperitoneum, most adrenocortical carcinomas are not diagnosed until they have grown quite large. They frequently invade large vessels, such as the renal vein and inferior vena cava, as well as metastasizing via the lymphatics and through the blood to the lungs and other organs. The most effective treatment is surgery, although this is not feasible for many patients, and the overall prognosis of the disease is poor. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy may also be employed in the treatment of this disease.\nThe adrenal medulla is located anatomically at the center of each adrenal gland, and is composed of neuroendocrine (chromaffin) cells which produce and release epinephrine (adrenaline) into the bloodstream in response to activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma are the two most important tumors which arise from the adrenal medulla. Both tumors may also arise from extra-adrenal sites, specifically, in the paraganglia of the sympathetic chain.\nMain article: Neuroblastoma\nNeuroblastoma is an aggressive cancer of immature neuroblastic cells (precursors of neurons), and is one of the most common pediatric cancers, with a median age at diagnosis of two years. Adrenal neuroblastoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass. Although the tumor has often spread to distant parts of the body at the time of diagnosis, this cancer is unusual in that many cases are highly curable when the spread is limited to the liver, skin, and/or bone marrow (stage IVS). Related, but less aggressive tumors composed of more mature neural cells include ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma. Neuroblastic tumors often produce elevated levels of catecholamine hormone precursors, such as vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid, and may produce severe watery diarrhea through production of vasoactive intestinal peptide. Treatment of neuroblastoma includes surgery and radiation therapy for localized disease, and chemotherapy for metastatic disease.\nMain article: Pheochromocytoma\nPheochromocytoma is a neoplasm composed of cells similar to the chromaffin cells of the mature adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytomas occur in patients of all ages, and may be sporadic, or associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types IIA and IIB, neurofibromatosis type I, or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Only 10% of adrenal pheochromocytomas are malignant, while the rest are benign tumors. The most clinically important feature of pheochromocytomas is their tendency to produce large amounts of the catecholamine hormones epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. This may lead to potentially life-threatening high blood pressure, or cardiac arrythmias, and numerous symptoms such as headache, palpitations, anxiety attacks, sweating, weight loss, and tremor. Diagnosis is most easily confirmed through urinary measurement of catecholamine metabolites such as VMA and metanephrines. Most pheochromocytomas are initially treated with anti-adrenergic drugs to protect against catecholamine overload, with surgery employed to remove the tumor once the patient is medically stable."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What causes glomerulosclerosis?", "output": "The cause of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is usually unknown.\nKnown causes include:\nHeroin use HIV Inherited genetic problems Obesity Reflux nephropathy (a condition in which urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidney) Sickle cell disease"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the additional diagnostic tests for lung cancer?", "output": "Bone scan may demonstrate bone metastases.\nFDG (18 F fluoro-deoxyglucose) PET scans along with contrast enhanced CT may be helpful in the evaluation of the extent of lung cancer.

Teenagers in particular occasionally rebel against the dietary strictures and suffer relapses or complications as a result. The widespread use of wheat byproducts in prepared food, soups and sauces can make dining out problematic. This is especially true in the United States, where dermatitis herpetiformis disease is less widely-known among the wider population than it is in Europe. However, certain types of restaurants (e.g., Japanese, Thai, Indian, and Latin American) already offer a wide range of gluten-free menu options, and many major restaurant chains have responded to growing awareness of celiac disease (and by default dermatitis herpetiformis) by posting information about the gluten content of their menu items on their websites.\nIt is important for friends and family to understand that dermatitis herpetiformis is present for life.\nAs celiac disease has become better understood, the availability of gluten-free replacements for everyday treats such as muffins, bagels, pasta and the like has continually improved, as has their quality. This has also benefited those with dermatitis herpetiformis. People with dermatitis herpetiformis and/or celiac cannot eat only gluten-free foods but continue to consume one or two products that contain gluten. For example, drinking beer can still cause symptoms, but even this problem may now be overcome. There are many specialty brews around the world that may be described as gluten free beer.\nHowever, the case of beer raises the main problem of dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease: while the diet is strict and the effects of the disease are serious, the main symptom of the disease can be social isolation with those with dermatitis herpetiformis afraid to become involved in normal social life. Parties can be difficult, weddings and funerals hard, holidays awkward, a meal out a nightmare, travel is made more stressful, and even the trip to a bar or pub one that requires the individual to be constantly aware of the disease. It is too easy for the celiacs and those with dermatitis herpetiformis to withdraw from these normal activities, and many people with these complaints are working to create normal activities where they can forget the problem. It is important for newly diagnosed with either dermatitis herpetiformis or celiacs to ensure that they remain involved in their social life and explain their needs to family and friends.\nAlthough these diseases may tend to isolate individuals with the complaint, the situation is becoming less difficult year by year. Manufacturers are now making a wide range of very acceptable breads, and some pastas (notoriously horrible in the past) that are virtually indistinguishable from \"normal\" pasta. Restaurants are beginning to offer gluten free menus and are recognizing the size of the market that is largely not catered for. Celiacs and those with dermatitis herpetiformis should not be afraid to ask establishments how they can cater to them. Where the question has been asked repeatedly, the proprietors tend to recognize the need, and become aware of the revenue that is lost where they do not provide a full range of products.\nIn many ways beer seems to be the hardest gluten free product to \"get right\". However, gluten-free beer is now available and there is now a range of ales, beers, and lagers to choose from. Around the world standards of \"gluten free\" vary. For example, while in the United Kingdom a beer with less than 20 parts per million gluten (20ppm) is \"gluten free\", in Australia it is not possible to describe any product as such if any gluten can be detected at all. Similarly, some \"gluten free\" breads can contain low levels of gluten in one country, in another they would contravene labeling or food standards legislation.\nHowever, large scale commercial beers are out of the question for those who cannot consume gluten,    regardless of the sometimes misleading advice on some brewery websites. It is likely that most people with dermatitis herpetiformis celiacs will be able to drink beer at under 20ppm (in moderation) without causing themselves any harm. It is important, however, for consumers of all \"low gluten\" foods and beverages to tell their consultant, and to ensure that even if the obvious symptoms are absent, there are no other negative effects continuing that they are unaware of.\nHowever, the development of a range of gluten free beers is an example of those who cannot consume gluten \"working together to socialize normally and avoid isolation caused by their special dietary needs. It also represents part of the return to a \u2018normal\u2019 life.\""}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the relationship between Adrenergic and myocarditis?", "output": "Surgical resection of the tumor is the ultimate treatment to remove excess catecholamines from the body.

The recommended practice which is followed currently is to acquire a tissue biopsy sample, with the exception of patients who have a characteristic elevation in tumor markers and in whom surgical intervention may lead to significant complications. Partial and gross total surgical resection of germinomas has no proven benefit and may lead to endocrinological and neurological deterioration. Therefore, in these patients surgical intervention is limited to biopsy and these patients are treated with radiation and chemotherapy. Since patients with choriocarcinoma have an increased tendency to hemorrhage, these patients are treated with early and radical surgery. Since patients with NGGCTs have poor long-term survival, therefore surgery for these patients is aimed at improving outcome. When removal of all tumor tissue is not possible in these patients reduction of tumor burden by partial resection is often an option available. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy are often incorporated in the treatment plan. There are no definitive data that suggest that gross total resection of NGGCT at the time of diagnosis improves either an overall survival or a progression-free survival. However, resection of residual tumors after radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may have a role, with a few small studies suggesting that gross total resection may improve survival. In patients with small surgical samples that may not be representative, such as histological diagnosis of pure germinoma and raised alpha-fetoprotein should be treated more aggressively than those with pure germinoma with normal CSF / serum markers. Patients with a tissue diagnosis of nongerminomatous germ cell tumors NGGCT should be treated as such regardless of serum/CSF tumor markers. Patients who presents with obstructive hydrocephalus may require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Surgery may be performed to remove the residual tissue and permit its histological verification in patients who have had an incomplete response to initial chemotherapy. The residual tissue may contain malignant components; however, it may consist of necrosis, fibrosis, or a mature teratoma\u2014the so-called growing teratoma syndrome.

Commonly, a person is first exposed to the virus during or after adolescence.\nOnce the acute symptoms of an initial infection disappear, they often do not return. But once infected, the patient carries the virus for the rest of their life. The virus typically lives dormantly in B lymphocytes. Independent infections of mononucleosis may be contracted multiple times, regardless of whether the patient is already carrying the virus dormantly.\nPeriodically, the virus can reactivate, during which time the patient is again infectious, but usually without any symptoms of illness. Usually, a patient has few, if any, further symptoms or problems from the latent B lymphocyte infection. However, in susceptible hosts under the appropriate environmental stressors, reactivation of the virus is observed and known to cause vague subclinical symptoms or remain mostly asymptomatic and is diagnosed by positive serologic response. Additionally, its imperative to note that during this phase the virus can spread to others.\nSimilar such reactivation or chronic sub-clinical viral activity in susceptible hosts may trigger multiple host autoimmune diseases and cancers secondary to EBV's predilection to B lymphocytes (the primary antibody-producing cell of the immune system) and its ability to alter both lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte antibody production.  \nBurkitt's lymphoma is a type of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is most common in the equatorial Africa. It is co-existent with the presence of malaria. Malarial infection is shown to reduce the immune surveillance of EBV immortalized B cells; thereby, allowing their proliferation which in turn increases the chance of a mutation to occur. Repeated such mutations lead to the escape of B cells from cell-cycle control and furthermore allow the cells to proliferate unchecked, resulting in the formation of Burkitt's lymphoma. Commonly affects the jaw bone, forming a huge tumor mass. Responds quickly to chemotherapy treatment, namely cyclophosphamide, but recurrence is common.\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma is a cancer found in the upper respiratory tract, most commonly in the nasopharynx, and is linked to the EBV virus. Occurs secondary to both genetic and environmental factors Predominantly prevalent in Southern China and Africa. It is much more common in people of Chinese ancestry (genetic), but is also linked to the Chinese diet of a high amount of smoked fish, which contain nitrosamines, well known carcinogens (environmental). \nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, EBV became the favored explanation for chronic fatigue syndrome. It was noted that people with chronic exhaustion had EBV, although it was also noted EBV was present in almost everyone.\nIn a four year study, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the virus did not adhere to Koch's Postulates and therefore had no definitive association between CFS and EBV but it is still being studied by researchers.\nMajority of the chronic post-infectious fatigue state appear not to be caused by a chronic viral infection, but be triggered by the acute infection.\nDirect and indirect evidence of persistent viral infection has been found in CFS, for example in muscle and via detection of an unusually low molecular weight RNase L enzyme, although the commonality and significance of such findings is disputed. Hickie et al, contend that mononucleosis appears to cause a hit and run injury to the brain in the early stages of the acute phase, thereby causing the chronic fatigue state. This would explain why in mononucleosis, fatigue very often lingers for months after the Epstein Barr Virus has been controlled by the immune system. However, it has also been noted in several (although altogether rare) cases that the only symptom displayed by a mononucleosis sufferer is elevated moods and higher energy levels, virtually the opposite of CFS and comparable to hypomania.\nJust how infectious mononucleosis changes the brain and causes fatigue (or lack thereof) in certain individuals remains to be seen. Such a mechanism may include activation of microglia in the brain of some individuals during the acute infection, thereby causing a slowly dissipating fatigue."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is information about adjustment disorder?", "output": "Adjustment disorder is an emotional and behavioral reaction that develops within 3 months of a life stress, and which is stronger or greater than what would be expected for the type of event that occurred."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the main method of preventing Chagas disease?", "output": "Methods of primary prevention of Chagas disease include use of insecticides to control the vector, use of new construction compounds in building walls and roofs, and organ/blood testing prior to donation."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the pharmacodynamic characteristics of Moxonidine?", "output": "Effects on insulin resistance\nIn all animal models of insulin resistance, moxonidine had striking effects on the development of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and impaired glucose homeostasis.

According to the affected lid structure and the location of the predominant inflammation, marginal blepharitis can be divided into:    \nAnterior blepharitis\nAnterior blepharitis describes an inflammation of the lid margin anterior to the gray line and concentrated around the lashes. It may be accompanied by squamous debris or collarettes around the lashes, and inflammation may spill onto the posterior lid margin.\nPosterior blepharitis\nPosterior blepharitis describes an inflammation of the posterior lid margin, which may have different causes, including meibomian gland dysfunction, conjunctival inflammation (allergic or infective), and/or other conditions, such as acne rosacea.\nBlepharitis can also be classified as acute or chronic, depending on the acuity of onset and time course of clinical presentation: \nAcute blepharitis\nAcute ulcerative blepharitis Acute ulcerative blepharitis is typically caused by staphylococcal infection. It may also be caused by herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus.

The life cycles of all five human schistosomes are broadly similar.  \nSchistosomal eggs are released into the environment from infected individuals. The schistosomal eggs hatch on contact with fresh water to release the free-swimming miracidium. Miracidia infect fresh-water snails by penetrating the snail's foot. After infection, the miracidium transforms into a primary sporocyst. Germ cells within the primary sporocyst will then begin dividing to produce secondary sporocysts, which migrate to the snail's hepatopancreas. Once at the hepatopancreas, germ cells within the secondary sporocyst begin to divide producing thousands of new parasites, known as cercariae, which are the larvae capable of infecting mammals. Cercariae emerge daily from the snail host in a circadian rhythm, dependent on ambient temperature and light. Young cercariae are highly motile, alternating between vigorous upward movement and sinking to maintain their position in the water. Cercarial activity is particularly stimulated by water turbulence, by shadows and by chemicals found on human skin.\nPenetration of the human skin occurs after the cercaria have attached to and explored the skin. The parasite secretes enzymes that break down the skin's protein to enable penetration of the cercarial head through the skin. As the cercaria penetrates the skin it transforms into a migrating schistosomulum stage. The newly transformed schistosomulum may remain inside the skin for 2 days before locating a post-capillary venule. The schistosomulum travels from the skin to the lungs where it undergoes further developmental changes necessary for subsequent migration to the liver. Eight to ten days after penetration of the skin, the parasite migrates to the liver sinusoids. The nearly-mature worms pair, with the longer female worm residing in the gynaecophoric channel of the male. S. haematobium schistosomula ultimately migrates from the liver to the perivesical venous plexus of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys through the hemorrhoidal plexus. Parasites reach maturity in six to eight weeks, at which time they begin to produce eggs. S. haematobium eggs pass through the ureteral or bladder wall and into the urine. Only mature eggs are capable of crossing into the digestive tract, possibly through the release of proteolytic enzymes, but also as a function of host immune response, which fosters local tissue ulceration. Up to half the eggs released by the worm pairs become trapped in the mesenteric veins, or will be washed back into the liver, where they will become lodged. Trapped eggs mature normally, secreting antigens that elicit a vigorous immune response. The eggs themselves do not damage the body rather it is the cellular infiltration resultant from the immune response that causes the pathology classically associated with schistosomiasis.\nInfection can occur by:\nPenetration of the human skin by cercaria Handling of contaminated soil Consumption of contaminated water or food sources (e.g, unwashed garden vegetables)\nCercaria gets transformed into migrating schistosomulum stage in the skin. Migrating schistosomulum are transported via the blood stream to respective organ system.\nThe incubation period for acute schistosomiasis is usually 14-84 days.\nCercaria are the infective stage of schistosomiasis to humans.\nMiracidium is diagnostic for schistosomiasis.\nThe pathogenesis of acute human schistosomiasis is related to egg deposition and liberation of antigens of adult worms and eggs.  A strong inflammatory response characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins 1 and 6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and by circulating immune complexes participates in the pathogenesis of the acute phase of the disease.\nBoth the early and late manifestations of schistosomiasis are immunologically mediated.   The major pathology of infection occurs with chronic schistosomiasis. Eggs may be trapped at sites of deposition (urinary bladde r, ureters, intestine) or be carried by the bloodstream t o other organs, most commonly the liver and less often the lungs and central nervous system. The host response to these eggs involves local as well as systemic manifestations. The cell-mediated immune response leads to granulomas composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils that surround the trapped eggs and add significantly to the degree of tissue destruction. Granuloma formation in the bladder wall and at the ureterovesical junction results in the major disease manifestations of schistosomiasis haematobia (hematuria, dysuria, and obstructive uropathy). Intestinal, as well as hepatic granulomas, underlie the pathologic sequelae of the other schistosome infections(ulcerations and fibrosis of intestinal wall, hepatosplenomegaly, and portal hypertension) due to pre-sinusoidal obstruction of blood flow. Anti-schistosome inflammation increases circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines. These responses are associated with hepcidin -mediated inhibition of iron uptake and use, leading to anemia of chronic inflammation. Schistosomiasis-related undernutrition may be the result of similar pathways of chronic inflammation. Acquired partial protective immunity against schistosomiasis has been demonstrated in some animal species and may occur in humans."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the management of myopia?", "output": "Practitioners and advocates of alternative therapies often recommend eye exercises and relaxation techniques such as the Bates method.

However, a larger placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2006 found that DHEA supplementation in elderly men and women had no beneficial effects on body composition, physical performance, insulin sensitivity, or quality of life. \nDHEA supplements are sometimes used as muscle-building or performance-enhancing drugs by athletes. However, a randomized placebo-controlled trial found that DHEA supplementation had no effect on lean body mass, strength, or testosterone levels. \nA 1986 study found that a higher level of endogenous DHEA, as determined by a single measurement, correlated with a lower risk of death or cardiovascular disease.  However, a more recent 2006 study found no correlation between DHEA levels and risk of cardiovascular disease or death in men. \nSome in vitro studies have found DHEA to have an anti-proliferative or apoptotic effect on cancer cell lines.    The clinical significance of these findings, if any, is unknown. Higher levels of DHEA, in fact, have been correlated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women.  \nA 2002 review found that DHEA was difficult to study in an animal model. The authors concluded that there was no evidence that DHEA was beneficial for any of the conditions for which it had been studied to that point, that it was associated with significant side effects, and that based on these findings, \"there is currently no scientific reason to prescribe DHEA for any purpose whatsoever.\" \nIn the United States, dietary supplements containing DHEA or DHEAS have been advertised with claims that they may be beneficial for a wide variety of ailments. DHEA and DHEAS are readily available in the United States, where they are regulated as foods rather than as medications. Given the lack of any proven benefit from DHEA supplementation, a 2004 review in the American Journal of Sports Medicine concluded that \"The marketing of this supplement's effectiveness far exceeds its science.\""}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are some other diagnostic tests used for identifying diffuse large B cell lymphoma?", "output": "Other diagnostic studies for diffuse large B cell lymphoma include: \nLaparoscopy (rarely performed) Laparotomy (rarely performed) Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Can you provide any information about fleas?", "output": "The goal of treatment is to get rid of the fleas by treating the home, pets, and outside areas with insecticide.

This entity accounts for 7% of children and 12% of adults with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. MPGN causes significant proportion of the cases of nephritis among patients in nonindustrialized countries. For example, in Mexico, MPGN accounts for 40% of all patients with nephritis. Most of these patients have type I disease; MPGN type II is uncommon. However, the incidence of MPGN type I is decreasing progressively in developed countries, which may be explained by a change in environmental factors, especially a decline in infections. In an investigation of the changing patterns of adult primary glomerular disease occurrence in a single region of the United Kingdom, Hanko analyzed the results of 1844 native renal biopsies taken between 1976 and 2005 (inclusive) and found the presence of primary glomerulonephritis was revealed in 49% of the biopsies, with the most common forms being immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (38.8%). Other common forms were membranous nephropathy (29.4%), minimal-change disease (MCD) (9.8%), MPGN type 1 (9.6%), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (5.7%). The incidence of IgA nephropathy increased significantly over the study period, whereas the occurrence of membranous nephropathy decreased. In the United States, MPGN predominantly affects the white population. Type I disease affects women more often than men, whereas a nearly equal sex distribution is seen in MPGN type II. The idiopathic forms of MPGN are more common in children and young adults (range, 6-30 y). Isolated reports of involvement in patients as young as 2 years and as old as 80 years are noted in the literature. Secondary types of MPGN predominate among adults. By dividing glomerular diseases into two subtypes, which are Nephrotic or Nephritic, subdividing into several specific disease will be much more easier  .The incidence of MPGN (as a lesion in renal biopsies) ranges from 1.4 to 9.3 cases per million population  (pmp) per year and with few exceptions, the incidence has decreased over time."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What classification does Toxoplasmosis belong to?", "output": "Acute: If the duration of symptoms is less than 4-6 weeks Chronic: If the symptoms persist for more than 6 weeks.\nNeurotoxoplasmosis (cerebral toxoplasmosis) Pulmonary toxoplasmosis Occular toxoplasmosis Congenital toxoplasmosis"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What information does an MRI provide for someone with acute viral nasopharyngitis?", "output": "There are no MRI findings associated with acute viral nasopharyngitis."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is meant by blood type?", "output": "Transfusion medicine is a specialized branch of hematology that is concerned with the study of blood groups, along with the work of a blood bank to provide a transfusion service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed physician or surgeon) in a similar way as medicines. In the USA, blood products are tightly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.\nMuch of the routine work of a blood bank involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and is as safe as possible. If a unit of incompatible blood is transfused between a donor and recipient, a severe acute immunological reaction, hemolysis (RBC destruction), renal failure and shock are likely to occur, and death is a possibility. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the complement system to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.\nPatients should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a transfusion reaction. Risks can be further reduced by cross-matching blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's blood with a sample of the donor's blood and checking to see if the mixture agglutinates, or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for agglutination with a microscope. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient. In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labeling has been standardized using a barcode system known as ISBT 128.\nThe blood group may be included on identification tags or on tattoos worn by military personnel, in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion. Frontline German Waffen-SS had such tattoos during World War II. Ironically, this was an easy form of SS identification. \nRare blood types can cause supply problems for blood banks and hospitals. For example Duffy -negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of African origin,  and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of Duffy-negative blood for patients of African ethnicity. Similarly for RhD negative people, there is a risk associated with travelling to parts of the world where supplies of RhD negative blood are rare, particularly East Asia, where blood services may endeavor to encourage Westerners to donate blood. \nA pregnant woman can make IgG blood group antibodies if her fetus has a blood group antigen that she does not have. This can happen if some of the fetus' blood cells pass into the mother's blood circulation (e.g. a small fetomaternal hemorrhage at the time of childbirth or obstetric intervention), or sometimes after a therapeutic blood transfusion. This can cause Rh disease or other forms of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in the current pregnancy and/or subsequent pregnancies. If a pregnant woman is known to have anti-RhD antibodies, the RhD blood type of a fetus can be tested by analysis of fetal DNA in maternal plasma to assess the risk to the fetus of Rh disease.  Antibodies associated with some blood groups can cause severe HDN, others can only cause mild HDN and others are not known to cause HDN."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the significance of MRI in the diagnosis of dermatomyositis?", "output": "Utilizing an MRI for the diagnosis of dermatomyositis is useful because it can detect subtle muscle inflammation and swelling in early stages of the disease."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you give me an overview of Papillorenal syndrome, please?", "output": "The renal coloboma syndrome differentials include most of the disease with renal and ocular anomalies.

A person who is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa is most commonly referred to with the adjectival form anorexic. The noun form, as in'he is an anorectic', is used less commonly. The term \" anorectic \" can also refer to any drug that suppresses appetite.\n\"Anorexia nervosa\" is frequently shortened to \" anorexia \" in both the popular media and scientific literature. This is technically incorrect, as strictly speaking \"anorexia\" refers to the medical symptom of reduced appetite.\nIn popular culture, and especially with anorectics themselves, the term is often shortened to \"ana\" to avoid sounding clinical and impersonal. \" Pro-ana \" groups often use the terms \"ana\" and \"mia\" (referring to bulimia nervosa) to describe their conditions, as it has less negative connotations than the full medical term. Some pro-ana groups discourage or deride the use of colloquial abbreviations.\nThe history of anorexia nervosa begins with the first recognition and description of anorexia as a disease in the late 19th century. It became widely known, particularly in the United States, in the 1980s.\nIn the late 19th century, the public attention drawn to \" fasting girls \" provoked conflict between religion and science. Such cases as Sarah Jacob (the \"Welsh Fasting Girl\") and Mollie Fancher (the \"Brooklyn Enigma\") stimulated controversy as experts weighed the claims of complete abstinence from food. Believers referenced the duality of mind and body, while skeptics insisted on the laws of science and material facts of life. Critics accused the fasting girls of hysteria, superstition, and deceit. The progress of secularization and medicalization passed cultural authority from clergy to physicians, transforming anorexia nervosa from revered to repulsed.\nDuring the period when this disease was first named \"anorexia nervosa\", in the early to mid 19th century, as opposed to its original title that assumed it was a type of hysteria, doctors began to emphasize and isolate what procedures and techniques contributed to the most successful recoveries in the young women afflicted. One of the most commonly shared opinions in treatment was the isolation of the patient from family, friends, loved ones, and any social connections which in technical terms is termed as a parentectomy. Theories of the reasons for the development and spread of the disease in Victorian society is rooted in the idea of a close-knit and involved family, and especially mothers in their young privileged daughter's life. Women were expected to behave eloquently and were controlled and under constant supervision. It is hypothesized that this was a daughter's way of controlling her life and of trying to look better in society; having control of what was going into her body was the one aspect in her life she fully dominated. It was documented by many physicians that most often as soon as girls were isolated from their social pressures they made quick and successful recoveries from the diseases. Also it was stated that it was the professional and moral authority of doctors and nurses that forced anoretics to begin eating again, and that they did so out of fear of the doctors.\nEarly treatment of anorexia nervosa is illustrated in the novel Second Star to the Right by Deborah Hautzig. In the story, an anorexic girl named Leslie is placed in the behavior-modification ward in a hospital. She is required to drink at least of liquid food per day, or else she is involuntarily force fed by hospital wardens. While the story does fall short in depicting the harsh reality of hospitalized anorexic, it does provide an accurate description of one of the first medical procedures against anorexia nervosa - Force feeding. Other forms of early treatment included \"drug therapy, psychoanalysis, dynamic psychotherapy, family therapy, behavior modification, peer counseling and support groups social skills training, assertiveness training, projective art therapy, hypnosis, relaxation techniques, movement therapy,nutritional education, and even sex education.\" Early treatment was usually a combination of a monitored eating program and psychological instruction which aimed to raise the patients awareness of the disorder and also to promote psychological growth. However, treatments varied on the amount of emphasis placed on the eating program or the psychological instruction. Some programs regarded immediate weight gain as the first step in recovery and psychological growth second, while others emphasized the psychological treatment of the patient over the weight gaining program. Forced feeding was reserved for the most dangerous cases of anorexia nervosa, where a patient becomes so emaciated that his/her life may be in jeopardy. A patient undergoing forced feeding would have invasive tubes placed in his/her nose where food would pass into the body, or could undergo a relatively new process called total parenteral nutrition (TNP). TNP is best described as the process where \"an intravenous catheter is inserted so that the tip lies in a large vein near the heart, where blood flow is relatively rapid. Then a concentrated fluid containing a balance of nutrition is infused at a steady rate.\" The cost of these medical procedures is very high, their success or effectiveness is not guaranteed, and the procedures can vary greatly from doctor to doctor, making anorexia nervosa one of the more difficult disorders to treat.\nAnorexia nervosa is thought to be a new disease by most people of today\u2019s society. This disease, however, is known to have existed since the late 19th century. Today anorexia nervosa is classified as a disease. During the Victorian Era, the disorder was thought to be a form of hysteria that affected mainly women of the middle and upper classes. Obesity during this era was thought to be a characteristic of poverty. In general however, the ideal woman\u2019s body type during the Victorian era was one that was curvy and full- figured. Many women attempted to achieve this body type through the use of corsets. The role of restrictive corsets during the Victorian era shows the early focus on body type and exemplifies how women, as early as the late 18th century, have been taking extreme measures to achieve the believed ideal body type. (Brumberg, \"Fasting Girls\"), (Carol Lawson, \"Anorexia: It's Not a New Disease\")\nAlthough the medical facts of anorexia nervosa have been documented since the 1870s, personal details of anorexics' lives are more publicized today than ever before. Since Karen Carpenter's death in 1983, which resulted from complications of the disorder, people recognize and casually label overly thin women as anorexics. Since the late 1980s, many special eating disorder clinics have opened, but it may be difficult to change the eating behavior and mindset of an anorexia victim, especially when they are surrounded by numerous other thin women who have similar eating behaviors. Today, many young women are obsessed with dieting as a form of cultural expression and a way to look as thin as models and celebrities. Anorexia nervosa seems to be more prevalent as the ideal female body image becomes thinner; however, the disorder may have always been this widespread but just less publicized.\nIn the 1980s, slimness embodied the ideal of feminine beauty. It is this that caused many women to incessantly diet in order to keep up with the demands of modern fashion. In a 1984 survey carried out by Glamor magazine of thirty-three thousand women between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five, 75 percent believed they were fat, although only 25 percent were actually overweight (Palm Beach Post, December 26, 1985). Indications of being thin was important to women of the upper class, and this class specific cultural model was pervasive throughout the media including television, film, magazines, and advertising After Growing Pains actress Tracey Gold nearly died from severe complications caused by self-starvation, anorexia in children and adolescents became a more serious issue than in adults. Various pediatric organizations now focus on this issue with methods of counseling designed for the under-18 age groups."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What exactly is primary central nervous system lymphoma?", "output": "There are no known direct causes for primary central nervous system lymphoma.

The three fatty acids RCOOH, R'COOH and R\"COOH can be all different, all the same, or only two the same.\nChain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. Natural fatty acids found in plants and animals are typically composed only of even numbers of carbon atoms due to the way they are bio-synthesised from acetyl CoA. Bacteria, however, possess the ability to synthesise odd- and branched-chain fatty acids. Consequently, ruminant animal fat contains odd numbered fatty acids, such as 15, due to the action of bacteria in the rumen.\nMost natural fats contain a complex mixture of individual triglycerides; because of this, they melt over a broad range of temperatures. Cocoa butter is unusual in that it is composed of only a few triglycerides, one of which contains palmitic, oleic and stearic acids in that order. This gives rise to a fairly sharp melting point, causing chocolate to melt in the mouth without feeling greasy.\n\nGeneral structure of a triglyceride Example of an unsaturated fat triglyceride.

Mumps virus is a member of the paramyoxoviridae family with a single-strand, negative-sense RNA molecule. The mumps HN and F glycoproteins reach the surface of the infected host cell through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex.  Virions emerge from the infected cells due to the M protein facilitating the localization of the viral ribonucleic proteins onto the host cell membrane.  The virus binds with the neighboring host cells via sialic acid through HN glycoprotein.  Both HN and F glycoproteins mediate the fusion of virus and host cell, as well as cell and cell - membrane fusion, to perpetuate the spread of the virus throughout the host.  The virus replicates in the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes.  Upon replication, viremia occurs for three to five days, spreading to the salivary glands.  The parotid gland particularly susceptible to parotitis due to the lower rate of secretion.  Salivary flow rate is reduced due to the inflammation response. Reduced saliva flow rate in the parotid gland leads to a reduction in the salivary defense proteins IgA (sIgA) and IgG, increasing vulnerability of the parotid gland to infection.  Parotitis results from the inflammatory response to the presence of mumps virus in the parotid salivary gland.\nBacterial parotitis is most commonly caused by staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive coccal bacterium often found in the respiratory tract.

The most commonly used selective beta-1 blockers are metoprolol, atenolol, and bisoprolol."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the underlying abnormal physiological condition that causes hepatopulmonary syndrome?", "output": "Nitric oxide\nThe normal physiology of nitric oxide can be understood as follows:\nThe endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels use nitric oxide to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, thus dilating the artery and increasing blood flow. This underlies the action of nitroglycerin, amyl nitrate, \"poppers\" (isobutyl nitrite or similar) and other nitrate derivatives in the treatment of heart disease: The compounds are converted to nitric oxide (by a process that is not completely understood), which in turn dilates the coronary artery (blood vessels around the heart), thereby increasing its blood supply. Nitric oxide also acts on cardiac muscle to decrease contractility and heart rate. The vasodilatory actions of nitric oxide play a key role in renal control of extracellular fluid homeostasis. Nitric oxide also plays a role in erection of the penis. Nitric oxide is also a second messenger in the nervous system and has been associated with neuronal activity and various functions like avoidance learning.\nNitric oxide is synthesized by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). There are three isoforms of the NOS enzyme: endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS) - each with separate functions. The neuronal enzyme (NOS-1) and the endothelial isoform (NOS-3) are calcium-dependent and produce low levels of gas as a cell-signaling molecule. The inducible isoform (NOS-2) is calcium-independent and produces large amounts of gas which can be cytotoxic.\nNitric Oxide (NO) is of critical importance as a mediator of vasorelaxation in blood vessels. Platelet-derived factors, shear stress, angiotensin II, acetylcholine, and cytokines stimulate the production of NO by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). eNOS synthesizes NO from the terminal guanidine-nitrogen of L-arginine and oxygen and yields citrulline as a byproduct. NO production by eNOS is dependent on calcium - calmodulin and other cofactors. NO, a highly reactive free radical then diffuses into the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel and interacts with soluble guanylate cyclase. Nitric oxide stimulates the soluble guanylate cyclase to generate the second messenger cyclic GMP (3\u2019,5\u2019 guanosine monophosphate)from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The soluble cGMP activates cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase G (PKG or cGKI). PKG is a kinase that phosphorylates a number of proteins that regulate calcium concentrations, calcium sensitization, hyperpolarize cell through potassium channels, actin filament and myosin dynamic alterations that result in smooth muscle relaxation.(see smooth muscle article). .\nAngiogenesis\nThe underlying mechanisms behind angiogenesis are beginning to be discovered. The process may begin with vasodilatation mediated by nitric oxide followed by an increase in permeability mediated by VEGF. This increased permeability allows for plasma protein extravasation and scaffold formation. Endothelial cell migration is supported by adhesion molecules such as PECAM-1 and cadherins. The vascular smooth muscle cells detaching and loosening signaled by Ang2 enables the migration and sprouting of endothelial cells. The process of angiogenesis is initiated by VEGF by Ang1 and is required to stabilize the endothelial networks and to increase periendothelial cell interactions. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates inflammatory cells and promotes cell-cell interactions by molecules such as integrin. VEGF has morphogenic effects which allow endothelial cells cords to acquire and enlarge their lumen. Unfortunately, muscularization of the network is poorly understood. The process appears to be tissue-specific. In the coronary arteries, the epicardial layer appears to be the source of smooth muscle cells which migrate under PDGF-BB and VEGF stimulation. TGF-beta and downstream transcription factors Smads promote extracellular matrix production and solidify cell-cell interactions. FGF can help further this process resulting in arteriogenesis. In pathologic conditions such as ischemic myocardium, arteriogenesis can allow for as much as a 20-fold enlargement of collateral network vessels. Chemokines and cytokines are upregulated by increased collateral flow which results in monocyte recruitment. Monocytes produce proteinases which cause medial destruction and further remodeling. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF), and their stabilization by peptide regulator 39 help induce and potentiate the neovascularization process. Newer imaging techniques utilize knowledge of molecular mechanisms to help enhance image resolution and improve sensitivity and specificity.\nPulmonary microvascular dilation and angiogenesis are two central pathogenic features that drive abnormal pulmonary gas exchange in experimental hepatopulmonary syndrome, and thus might underlie hepatopulmonary syndrome in humans.   \n\nVasodilators\nThe exact pathogenesis of the hepatopulmonary syndrome is not completely understood.\nIt is thought that hepatopulmonary syndrome is the result of microscopic intrapulmonary arteriovenous dilatations due to either increased liver production or decreased liver clearance of vasodilators, possibly involving nitric oxide. \n   \nThe progression to hepatopulmonary syndrome is believed that involves the nitric oxide metabolism. The dilation of these blood vessels causes overperfusion relative to ventilation, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemi a. There is an increased gradient between the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli of the lung and adjacent arteries (alveolar-arterial A-a gradient) while breathing room air. Patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome have platypnea - orthodeoxia syndrome (POS); that is, because intrapulmonary vascular dilations (IPVDs) predominate in the bases of the lungs, standing worsens hypoxemia (orthodeoxia)/dyspnea (platypnea) and the supine positio n improves oxygenation as blood is redistributed from the bases to the apices. Additionally, late in cirrhosis, it is common to develop high output failure, which would lead to less time in capillaries per red blood cell, exacerbating the hypoxemia.\nAngiogenesis\nAs discussed below a variety of angiogenesis-related genes polymorphism has been linked to hepatopulmonary syndrome. An increased levels of endothelin-1 in cirrhotic patients have been correlated with intrapulmonary molecular and gas exchange abnormalities, hypothesizing a probable contribution to the pathogenesis of hepatopulmonary syndrome."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you provide me with the given sentence so I can rephrase it for you?", "output": "Marburg hemorrhagic fever must be differentiated from other viral hemorrhagic fevers that may cause fever, abdominal pain,and bleeding such as Ebola, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Hantavirus Infection, Rift Valley fever, Lujo hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever.

Because of its unique colony form, he referred to the species as Saccharomyces neoformans. In 1901, Jean Paul Vuillemin, a French mycologist, transferred the yeast-like fungus to the genus Cryptococcus due to the absence of ascospores in its life cycle, a defining feature of Saccharomyces.

Rather a better quality of tear is required with higher wetting ability (i.e greater amount of glycoproteins) and so artificial tears (eg viscotears) are applied frequently. Whilst individual episodes may settle within a few hours or days, additional episodes (as the name suggests) will recur at intervals.\nPatients with recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosions often show increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes.  These enzymes dissolve the basement membrane and fibrils of the hemidesmosomes, which can lead to the separation of the epithelial layer. Treatment with oral tetracycline antibiotics (such as doxycycline or oxytetracycline) together with a topical corticosteroid (such as prednisolone), reduce MMP activity and may rapidly resolve and prevent further episodes in cases unresponsive to conventional therapies."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Can you provide an overview of breast lumps?", "output": "Mammography is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of breast lumps in women aged >40 years old. Ultrasound is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of breast lumps in women aged <40 years old. Management and medical therapy of breast lumps depends on women's age (age> 40 or age <40) and mammography results in women aged > 40 years. In women aged > 40 years; no further evaluation is needed in case of clearly benign mass in mammography; however, ultrasound imaging is required for the rest of the findings mammography. Approach to breast lumps in women >40 years is depended on breast imaging reporting and data systems (BI-RADS) stages. Medical therapy of breast lumps in women< 40 years is depended on ultrasound results and BI-RADS categories.\nThe important key to breast lumps diagnosis is history and physical exams. History must be complete and include all details regarding to age, parity, pregnancy, past history of breast diseases, familial history, and drug history. Common symptoms of breast lumps include breast pain, palpable mass, nipple discharge, galactorrhea.\nPhysical examination of patients with breast lumps should perform both in sitting position and supine position to examine all 4 quadrants of breast. Careful physical examination may lead to diagnosis. Breast physical exam should include information about, number, size, location, shape, mobility, consistancy of masses, nipple discharge, and axillary lymph nodes.\nThere are no diagnostic laboratory findings associated with breast lumps.\nThere are no ECG findings associated with breast lumps.\nThere are no x-ray findings associated with breast lumps.\nBreast ultrasound is the first imaging modality in patients with palpable masses under age 40 years old and is adjunctive modality to mammography for patients older than 40 years. Breast sonography is a type of imaging used to confirm abnormal findings on mammography or MRI. Breast ultrasound improves breast cancer detection rate.\nThere are no CT scan findings associated with breast lumps.\nMRI is considered as the primary imaging modality in selected patients and may be used when results of other imaging modalities are indeterminate. Breast MRI has some indications and does not use regularly. Breast MRI is not the primary modality for diagnosis of breast lumps and does not provide any additional findings to ultrasound and mammographic results and has both false-positive and false-negetive results.\nMammography is considered as the first and mainstay for evaluation of palpable masses in women over the age of 40 years. Diagnostic mammogram contains particular views by focal compression of specific part of breast tissue.There is standard method for reporting mammographic findings which is called breast imaging reporting and database system (BI-RADS) which is classified into 7 categories.\nThe only certain method to approve the presence of breast malignancy is breast lump biopsy.The three types of biopsies are core-needle biopsy, open surgical biopsy, and fine needle biopsy. Core-needle biopsy has different types such as ultrasound guided-core needle biopsy, stereotactic-guided core-needle biopsy, MRI-guided core-needle biopsy, and freehand core-needle biopsy. Core-needle biopsy has high sensitivity and specificity. Triple test score is used by surgeons for assessment of palpable breast lumps.

One is a snail, the other is a bird or mammal. Schistosomes are gonochoristic and sexual reproduction takes place in the vertebrate host. In genera that infect birds, adult worms occur in tissues and veins of the host\u2019s gastrointestinal tract, where they produce eggs that are shed into water with host feces. One European species, Trichobilharzia regenti, instead infects the bird host\u2019s nasal tissues, where its eggs are shed with lachrymal secretions.\nOnce a schistosome egg is immersed in water, a short-lived, non-feeding, free-living stage known as the miracidium emerges. The miracidium uses cilia to follow chemical and physical cues thought to increase its chances of finding the first intermediate host in its life cycle, a snail. After infecting a snail, it develops into a mother sporocyst, which in turn undergoes asexual reproduction, yielding large numbers of daughter sporocysts, which asexually produce another short-lived, free-living stage, the cercaria. Cercariae use a tail-like appendage (often forked in genera causing swimmer\u2019s itch) to swim to the surface of the water, as well as other physical and chemical cues, in order to locate the next and final (definitive) host in the life cycle, a bird. After infecting a bird, the parasite develops into a schistosomulum and migrates through the host\u2019s circulatory system (or nervous system in case of T. regenti) to the final location within the host body where it matures and, if it encounters a mate, sheds eggs to begin the cycle."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Can you provide any information about Simvastatin?", "output": "Simvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

To date, the results of these and other adjuvant therapies have been mixed or not yet fully proven. Some side effects of antivirals include dizziness, headaches, and body aches.\nScientists and clinicians are working to discover more about laryngeal papillomatosis. While HPV 6 and HPV 11 are known causes, millions of people are exposed to these two viruses without developing the disease. It is not known why some people are more at risk than others or why some cases are much more serious than others.\nResearchers funded by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) are exploring how our genes and immune system may contribute to our risk for contracting the disease as well as the severity of its symptoms. Researchers are also studying other possible therapies for laryngeal papillomatosis. In one clinical trial, researchers are investigating whether a common anti-inflammatory drug can inhibit an enzyme that promotes tumor growth in laryngeal papillomatosis, thus reducing the recurrence of tumors in children and adults with laryngeal papillomatosis. Researchers are also investigating the effectiveness of a pulsed dye laser, a laser that delivers short intense pulses of light, to determine if it is more effective at preserving the surrounding tissue while removing tumors from vocal folds. In one NIDCD- sponsored clinical investigation, researchers are studying whether a certain dietary supplement can work with the pulsed dye laser to decrease the rate of recurrence of tumors in children with laryngeal papillomatosis.

There may also be a direct contractile effect on vascular smooth muscle.\nCocaine usage can also predispose to coronary thrombosis as a consequence of coronary spasm. Moreover, cocaine increases the response of platelets to arachidonic acid, thus increasing thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation and thus predisposing to cocaine related arterial thrombosis. Cocaine also causes sinus tachycardia, as well as an increase in blood pressure and myocardial contractility, thereby increasing myocardial oxygen demand. These increases can precipitate myocardial ischemia and UA / NSTEMI in both the presence and absence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis and coronary spasm.\nThe typical patient with cocaine related chest pain, unstable angina or MI is:\nYoung (usually less than 40 yrs) Male gender Cigarette smoker Has symptom onset minutes or even several hours after cocaine use.\nIt can occur with all routes of administration and with small or large doses.\nTreatment includes nitroglycerin and calcium channel blockers. If patients have STEMI and show no response to sublingual NTG and calcium channel blockers, immediate coronary angiography should be performed, if possible. PCI has been successfully performed in these patients but can problematic in subjects with cocaine-related MI since those in whom stents are deployed are at substantial risk of subsequent in- stent thrombosis unless double-antiplatelet therapy (ASA and clopidogrel) is ingested regularly and predictably for several months afterward, and those who partake in substance abuse often are unreliable in adhering to such a regimen. Beta blockers should not be used in patients with cocaine induced MI as it can augment cocaine induced coronary arterial vasoconstriction. In order to control sinus tachycardia and hypertension (after initial NTG and calcium channel blockers), labetalol, an alpha blocker and beta blocker, has been advocated, because it has been shown not to induce coronary artery vasoconstriction."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is Carcinoma and what are the different types of lung carcinoma?", "output": "Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor originating in the epithelial cells of glandular tissue and forming glandular structures.

For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis,  a titer of antibodies directed against Epstein-Barr virus or Lyme disease is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected, or the infection occurred a very long time ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed. In clinical immunology, levels of individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) to characterize the antibody profile of patient.  Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients whom the diagnosis is unclear.  For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis. Autoimmune disorders can often be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test.  The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.  Practically, several immunodiagnostic methods based on detection of complex antigen-antibody are used to diagnose infectious diseases, for example ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blot, immunodiffusion, and immunoelectrophoresis.\n\"Targeted\" monoclonal antibody therapy is employed to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,  multiple sclerosis,  psoriasis,  and many forms of cancer including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,  colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and breast cancer.  Some immune deficiencies, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, result in partial or complete lack of antibodies.  These diseases are often treated by inducing a short term form of immunity called passive immunity. Passive immunity is achieved through the transfer of ready-made antibodies in the form of human or animal serum, pooled immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies, into the affected individual. \nRho(D) Immune Globulin antibodies are specific for human Rhesus D antigen, also known as Rhesus factor.  These antibodies are known under several brand names, including RhoGAM. Rhesus factor is an antigen found on red blood cells; individuals that are Rhesus-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rhesus-negative (Rh-) do not. During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother's system. In the case of an Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.  RhoGAM is administered as part of a prenatal treatment regimen to prevent sensitization that may occur when a Rhesus-negative mother has a Rhesus-positive fetus. Treatment of a mother with RhoGAM antibodies prior to and immediately after trauma and delivery destroys Rh antigen in the mother's system from the fetus. Importantly, this occurs before the antigen can stimulate maternal B cells to \"remember\" Rh antigen by generating memory B cells. Therefore, her humoral immune system will not make anti-Rh antibodies, and will not attack the Rhesus antigens of the current or subsequent baby. RhoGAM treatment prevents sensitization that can lead to Rh disease, but does not prevent or treat the underlying disease itself."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the other diagnostic tests for hand-foot-and-mouth disease?", "output": "Hand foot mouth disease is a clinical diagnosis, there is no need for performing diagnostic tests."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the meaning of clitoromegaly and what are the factors that lead to it?", "output": "Clitoromegaly is otherwise a rare condition and can be either present by birth or acquired later in life. If present at birth, congenital adrenal hyperplasia can be one of the causes, since in this condition the adrenal gland of the female fetus produces additional androgens and the newborn baby has ambiguous genitalia which are not clearly male or female.\nIn acquired clitoromegaly, the main cause is due to hormonal imbalance affecting the adult women, as in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), arrhenoblastoma and Fraser syndrome.\nClitoromegaly may be acquired through use of anabolic steroids or testosterone supplements, both of which can cause enlargement of the clitoris. This occurs in Female to Male Transsexuals (FtM) after a period of hormone replacement therapy. Like FtM transsexuals, female body-builders who use androgens may also experience enlargement of the clitoris and increases in libido. Women who use testosterone for therapeutic reasons (treating low libido, averting osteoporosis, as part of an anti-depressant regimen, etc) may also experience some enlargement of the clitoris although the dosages warranted for these conditions is much lower.\nDeliberately induced clitoris enlargement, as form of female genital body modification, is reported to be achieved through testosterone injections directly in the clitoris shaft."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the MRI result for a glomus tumor?", "output": "MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of glomus tumor.

A small number of wounds that do not fall into these categories may be due to causes such as radiation poisoning or ischemia. \nVenous ulcers, which usually occur in the legs, account for about 70% to 90% of chronic wounds  and mostly affect the elderly. They are thought to be due to venous hypertension caused by improper function of valves that exist in the veins to prevent blood from flowing backward. Ischemia results from the dysfunction and, combined with reperfusion injury, causes the tissue damage that leads to the wounds.\nAnother major cause of chronic wounds, diabetes, is increasing in prevalence.  Diabetics have a 15% higher risk for amputation than the general population  due to chronic ulcers. Diabetes causes neuropathy, which inhibits the perception of pain.  Thus patients may not initially notice small wounds to legs and feet, and may therefore fail to prevent infection or repeated injury.  Further, diabetes causes immune compromise and damage to small blood vessels, preventing adequate oxygenation of tissue, which can cause chronic wounds.  Pressure also plays a role in the formation of diabetic ulcers. \nAnother leading type of chronic wounds is pressure ulcers,  which usually occur in people with conditions such as paralysis that inhibit movement of body parts that are commonly subjected to pressure such as the heels, shoulder blades, and sacrum.   Pressure ulcers are caused by ischemia that occurs when pressure on the tissue is greater than the pressure in capillaries, and thus restricts blood flow into the area.  Muscle tissue, which needs more oxygen and nutrients than skin does, shows the worst effects from prolonged pressure.

The heart and vessels are accessed via median sternotomy. The heart/lung machine (cardiopulmonary bypass machine) is connected. Since, the heart/lung machine needs its \"circulation\" to be filled with blood, a child will require a blood transfusion for this surgery. The patient is cooled for 20 minutes to 20 Celsius degree rectal temperature. Once the heart is stopped and emptied, the aorta and the pulmonary artery are divided. The site of the aortic transection is marked before the cross clamp is applied. The aorta and pulmonary artery are transected at a level above the valve sinuses. The ostium of the coronary arteries are excised along with a large segment of surrounding aortic wall and sutured into place in the neo-aorta (basal part of the pulmonary artery). The pulmonary trunk is moved forward into its new position anterior to the aorta. Finally, the switched great arteries are sutured into place. The heart is then allowed to fill and take over its normal function. Temporary pacemaker wires and drainage tubes are then placed and the chest is closed. Some arterial switch recipients may present with post-operative pulmonary stenosis, which would then be repaired with angioplasty, pulmonary stenting via heart cath or median sternotomy, and/or xenograft. Lecompte maneuver - During this surgery the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries are placed anterior to the aorta.

These patients usually go to the intensive care unit after surgery.\nSometimes when the brain is injured swelling occurs and fluids accumulate within the brain space. When an injury occurs inside the skull-encased brain, there is no place for swollen tissues to expand and no adjoining tissues to absorb excess fluid. This leads to an increase in the pressure within the skull, called intracranial pressure (ICP). High ICP can cause delicate brain tissue to be crushed, or parts of the brain to herniate across structures within the skull, potentially leading to severe damage. Medical personnel measure a patient's ICP using a probe or catheter. The instrument is inserted through the skull to the subarachnoid level and is connected to a monitor that registers ICP. If a patient has high ICP, he or she may undergo a ventriculostomy, a procedure that drains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles to bring the pressure down by way of an external ventricular drain.\nDecompressive craniectomy is a last-resort surgical procedure in which part of the skull is removed in an attempt to reduce severely high ICP."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What exactly is Zenker's diverticulum?", "output": "Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) also known as pharyngosophageal diverticulum.

Note that when mitral valve surgery is indicated, mitral valve repair is preferred over mitral valve replacement whenever feasible. \nAbbreviations: MR: mitral regurgitation\nMitral regurgitation is a syndrome of pure volume overload whereas aortic regurgitation is a combination of both volume and pressure overload. Both syndromes are associated with an increase in preload. In mitral regurgitation, the afterload is reduced whereas in aortic regurgitation the afterload is increased. This is very important because when the mitral valve is repaired, there is no longer a reduction afterload and the left ventricle may fail due to an abrupt rise in the afterload. In aortic regurgitation, because the afterload is already increased chronically, replacement of the valve is not as likely to precipitate acute left ventricular failure due to an abrupt rise in afterload. By the time symptoms develop, there is already left ventricular dysfunction. Because of the low pressure system into which the blood is ejected into through the mitral valve, the ejection fraction is always high in mitral regurgitation. If the ejection fraction appears to be \"normal\", there is already decline in left ventricular function. There is no indication for vasodilator therapy in the absence of systemic hypertension in asymptomatic patients with preserved left ventricular function.\nThere are two surgical options for the treatment of mitral regurgitation: mitral valve replacement and mitral valve repair. In general, mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement as it carries a lower risk of subsequent prosthetic valve endocarditis and results in better preservation of left ventricular function.\nThe ACC/AHA 2008 guidelines  recommend mitral valve repair rather than mitral valve replacement if the anatomy is appropriate, including patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease  and mitral valve prolapse  (Grade 1C).

Revascularization is a treatment of choice for myocardial ischemia. Survival after CABG in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia was reasonable. For patients with ischemic heart disease and reduced LVEF undergoing CABG, the risk of sudden cardiac death lessened compared with medical therapy. Among survival of SCD, the risk of death reduced by revascularization procedure including PCI or CABG. Ischemic heart disease is responsible for 24% to 55% of SCD cases in young patients <35 years of age. Anomalous aortic origin of the coronary arteries detected in 10% to 17% of patients in postmortem studies, is an important cause of SCD in the young. Revascularization is recommended for treating ischemia leading life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia due to anomalous aortic origin of the coronary arteries. Cardiac surgery is rarely performed for treating ventricular tachycardia in case of highly symptomatic patients with failed antiarrhythmic medications or unsuccessful ventricular ablation. Inaccessible sites for ventricular ablation including area deep in the myocardium, beneath epicardial fat, or near the coronary arteries may lead to unsuccessful ablation. Surgical ablation of ventricular arrhythmia can be done during other surgical intervention such as placement of LVAD or at the time of left ventricular aneurysectomy which is a substrate for VT. VT or VF maybe provoked by Sympathetic activation and maybe inhibited by parasympathetic activity. Prevention of ventricular arrhythmia can be done by interruption of sympathetic outflow to the heart, pharmacological beta-blockade, or through stimulation of the parasympathetic pathway (vagal nerve stimulators, spinal cord stimulators). Autonomic modulation is effective in conditions such as long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Efficacy for ventricular tachycardia is under investigation.

In three weeks, the larva passes from the respiratory system to be coughed up, swallowed, and thus returned to the small intestine, where it matures to an adult male or female worm. Fertilization can now occur and the female produces as many as 200,000 eggs per day for a year. These fertilized eggs become infectious after two weeks in soil; they can persist in soil for 10 years or more. \nThe eggs have a lipid layer which makes them resistant to the effects of acids and alkalis, as well as other chemicals.

Among them are: Culex (C. annulirostris, C. bitaeniorhynchus, C. quinquefasciatus, and C. pipiens); Anopheles (A. arabinensis, A. bancroftii, A. farauti, A. funestus, A. gambiae, A. koliensis, A. melas, A. merus, A. punctulatus and A. wellcomei); Aedes (A. aegypti, A. aquasalis, A. bellator, A. cooki, A. darlingi, A. kochi, A. polynesiensis, A. pseudoscutellaris, A. rotumae, A. scapularis, and A. vigilax); Mansonia (M. pseudotitillans, M. uniformis); Coquillettidia (C. juxtamansonia). During a blood meal, an infected mosquito introduces third-stage filarial larvae onto the skin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite wound (1). They develop in adults that commonly reside in the lymphatics (2). The female worms measure 80 to 100 mm in length and 0.24 to 0.30 mm in diameter, while the males measure about 40 mm by.1 mm. Adults produce microfilariae measuring 244 to 296 \u03bcm by 7.5 to 10 \u03bcm, which are sheathed and have nocturnal periodicity, except the South Pacific microfilariae which have the absence of marked periodicity. The microfilariae migrate into lymph and blood channels moving actively through lymph and blood (3). A mosquito ingests the microfilariae during a blood meal (4). After ingestion, the microfilariae lose their sheaths and some of them work their way through the wall of the proventriculus and cardiac portion of the mosquito's midgut and reach the thoracic muscles (5). There the microfilariae develop into first-stage larvae (6) and subsequently into third-stage infective larvae (7). The third-stage infective larvae migrate through the hemocoel to the mosquito's prosbocis (8) and can infect another human when the mosquito takes a blood meal (1).\nThe typical vector for Brugia malayi filariasis are mosquito species from the genera Mansonia and Aedes. During a blood meal, an infected mosquito introduces third-stage filarial larvae onto the skin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite wound (1). They develop into adults that commonly reside in the lymphatics (2). The adult worms resemble those of Wuchereria bancrofti but are smaller. Female worms measure 43 to 55 mm in length by 130 to 170 \u03bcm in width, and males measure 13 to 23 mm in length by 70 to 80 \u03bcm in width. Adults produce microfilariae, measuring 177 to 230 \u03bcm in length and 5 to 7 \u03bcm in width, which are sheathed and have nocturnal periodicity. The microfilariae migrate into lymph and enter the blood stream reaching the peripheral blood (3). A mosquito ingests the microfilariae during a blood meal (4). After ingestion, the microfilariae lose their sheaths and work their way through the wall of the proventriculus and cardiac portion of the midgut to reach the thoracic muscles (5). There the microfilariae develop into first-stage larvae (6) and subsequently into third-stage larvae (7). The third-stage larvae migrate through the hemocoel to the mosquito's prosbocis (8) and can infect another human when the mosquito takes a blood meal (1).\nA wide range of mosquitoes can transmit the parasite, depending on the geographic area.

Freckling can also be triggered by long exposure to sunlight, such as suntanning. When the sun\u2019s rays penetrate the skin, they activate melanocytes which can cause freckles to become darker and more numerous, although the distribution of melanin is not the same. Fair hair such as blonde, or more commonly red hair, are usually common with the genetic factor of freckles, but none so much as fair or pale skin.\nFreckles are predominantly found on the face, although they may appear on any skin exposed to the sun. Freckles are rare on infants, and more common on children before puberty; they are less common on adults.\nChildren who do not produce enough melanin to protect their skin against harmful rays from the sun develop temporary freckles associated with childhood that usually go away upon puberty, once more melanin is produced. People with the fairest skin often do not produce enough melanin, and so freckles are present after puberty and into adulthood, indicating that individual as a genetic carrier for freckles.\nUpon exposure to the sun, freckles will reappear if they have been altered with creams or lasers and not protected from the sun, but do however fade with age in some cases. Freckles are not a skin disorder. People with a predisposition to freckles may be especially susceptible to sunburn and skin cancer, and should therefore take extra care to protect themselves in the sun with a daily sunblock of at least 15 SPF.\nDuring the Middle Ages and up until the early 15th century in Europe, an excess of freckles (\"witchmarks\" or \"witchspots\") became associated with witchcraft and witche, most likely because of genetic pairing with red hair, also considered to be a quality of witches. \nEphelides is a genetic trait.

In common usage, it may refer to an inflammatory process involving the interior of the eye. The uvea consists of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid; it provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis may occur unilaterally or bilaterally, affect the anterior, intermediate, or posterior segment of the eye, may be infectious or non infectious, and granulomatous or non-granulomatous. The exact pathogenesis of uveitis is not fully understood. It is thought that uveitis is mediated by a genetic predisposition and an acquired cross immunity to infectious agents, or cross immunity to self-antigens due to underlying autoimmune diseases. Common causes of uveitis include seronegative spondyloarthropathy, sarcoidosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Beh\u00e7et syndrome, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, syphilis, and tuberculosis. Uveitis must be differentiated from other diseases such as conjunctivitis, endophthalmitis, or scleritis. A history of cigarette smoking is associated with all etiologies and subtypes of uveitis. Uveitis is estimated to be responsible for approximately 10% of the blindness in the United States. If left untreated uveitis can progress to permanent vision loss or result in complications such as cataracts, glaucoma, and retinal detachment. A history of an underlying associated condition along with symptoms of eye pain, redness, photophobia, floaters, and blurry vision is strongly suggestive of uveitis. There are no specific laboratory or physical examination findings associated with uveitis. Imaging modalities may assist in diagnosing an underlying condition, though have no diagnostic utility for uveitis itself. Slit lamp test is the diagnostic modality of choice. Other ophthalmologic studies may assist in further characterizing the disease. Mainstay medical therapy is by high dose corticosteroids. Targeted antimicrobials may be required to treat an underlying infection. Surgical intervention is reserved for managing complications of uveitis such as cataract surgery or glaucoma surgery. The only indicated guideline for screening is in patients suspected of or diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Prompt treatment of a potential underlying infection may help prevent development of uveitis."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the medical treatment for Goodpasture syndrome?", "output": "Currently there is no cure for Goodpasture syndrome.

Surgery is best reserved for patients with small tumors located in the sinonasal cavity without involvement of the orbit or skull base. For more advanced tumors, the successful treatment includes surgery and radiation therapy with most of the institutions favoring delivery of postoperative, rather than preoperative, radiotherapy. Large and bulky tumors (T3 and T4) are treated with preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by surgery. The optimal treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma includes complete surgical resection of the tumor followed by radiation therapy. However, some institutions have reported success with alternative treatment modalities, including surgery without radiation.\nDulguerov\u2019s 2001 meta-analysis showed lower recurrence rates for the combination of surgery and radiotherapy. The literature gives little support to single-modality treatments; only few studies have advocated either radiation or surgery alone.  Some institutions advocate surgery alone for Kadish stage A tumors, whereas the majority suggest adjuvant radiotherapy for these lesions.\nThe traditional surgical approach for esthesioneuroblastoma, is craniofacial resection (CFR). Craniofacial resection is a combined transcranial and transfacial approach, which includes a lateral rhinotomy or midfacial degloving and frontal craniotomy. The objective of this approach is to achieve an en bloc resection of tumor and involved structures. It also involves removal of the olfactory bulbs, cribriform plate, roof of the ethmoid sinuses, upper septum, medial maxillae, and as much of the anterior cranial fossa dura as necessary. The advent of craniofacial resection is credited with increase in overall survival for esthesioneuroblastoma patients. The postoperative morbidity (approximately 35%) and mortality (2-5%) with craniofacial resection is relatively high, although the complication rate associated with craniofacial resection has decreased over the last few decades.\nAlthough traditional craniofacial resection remains the gold standard, less invasive endoscopic techniques have become increasingly utilized. Minimally invasive endoscopic resection (MIER) is a complete endoscopic approach, most suited for tumors that have not invaded the brain tissue. Endoscopic-assisted cranionasal resection (EA-CNR) combines transnasal endoscopic approach with craniotomy and addresses large tumors that have invaded brain tissue. There are distinct advantages of EA-CNR and MIER over traditional CFR. Endoscopic techniques allow great access to anatomic areas where external approaches are notoriously known to fail, such as frontal recess and the sphenoid sinus region. The endoscope plays an important role in tumor surveillance, in the postoperative period. Finally, the endoscopic approach eliminates the need for disfiguring facial incisions. Endoscopic techniques have shown to have comparable success rates but fewer complications compared with traditional craniofacial resection."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is transferrinemia and what are the treatments for it?", "output": "Treatment with infusions of plasma or purified apotransferrin may stabilise or correct the anemia and growth defects."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the Ansa cervicalis?", "output": "Two roots make up the ansa cervicalis.\nThe superior root (descendens hypoglossi) of the ansa cervicalis is formed by a branch of spinal nerve C1.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict who will reinfarct following fibrinolytic therapy. Among patients undergoing primary PCI, bivalirudin monotherapy has been associated with stent thrombosis in the HORIZONS-AMI and EUROMAX trials.   Aggressive antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy minimizes the risk of reinfarction.\nA new murmur in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction should raise an immediate concern of mechanical complicaitons such as papillary muscle rupture, septal rupture, and free-wall rupture which portend a dismal prognosis and may be differentiated on the basis of physical and echocardiographic findings or hemodynamic profiles. Other mechanical sequelae include true or false ventricular aneurysm, dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure.\nA true left ventricular aneurysm is an outpouching formed by a stretched, thinned-out myocardial scar. Patients with transmural infarction and patients who do not receive reperfusion therapy are at increased risk. LV aneurysm may manifest acutely as low-output cardiogenic shock or chronically as heart failure or thromboembolism in the presence of mural thrombus. A large, diffuse point of maximal impulse and S 3 gallops may be evident on physical examination. A chest radiograph may demonstrate a localized bulging segment in the cardiac silhouette. Dyskinetic or paradoxical motions of the aneurysmal segment may be detected by echocardiography or ventriculography. True aneurysm connects with the LV cavity by a wide neck and is less susceptible to rupture than a false aneurysm. ACE inhibitor and vasodilator are used in the mangement of chronic heart failure associated with ventricular aneurysm. Anticoagulant is indicated in the presence of mural thrombus. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia from an aneurysm may require defibrillator placement. Surgical resection may be considered in selected cases with refractory symptoms.\nIn contrast to the true aneurysm which contains viable myocardium in its wall, pseudoaneurysm lacks the myocardial elements and is formed by adherent pericardium and organized hematoma. Unlike true ventricular aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm communicates with the cavity of the left ventricle through a narrow neck and is more prone to rupture. Pseudoaneurysm may partially reduce stroke volume similar to a true aneurysm. Surgery is recommended for all patients regardless of symptoms or the size of pseudoaneurysm in light of a high risk for spontaneous rupture and sudden death.\nPapillary muscle rupture is characterized by symptoms of acute severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary edema and should be suspected in STEMI patients with a new soft holosystolic murmur at the apex. Posterior papillary muscle rupture, as occurs in inferior MI, is more common than anterior papillary muscle rupture which may be a complication of anterior or lateral MI. Posterior papillary muscle is considered more susceptible to ischemic rupture due to its singular blood supply from the posterior descending artery. In contradistinction to the posterior papillary muscle, the anterior papillary muscle receives a dual blood supply from the left anterior descending artery and the circumflex artery.  Urgent transthoracic echocardiography should be obtained to establish a definite diagnosis. Nitroglycerin or nitroprusside may be used to temporize the patient if systolic blood pressure is above 90 mm Hg. If the patient cannot tolerate vasodilator due to rapid hemodynamic deterioration, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be instituted as a bridging therapy until emergency mitral valve replacement can be performed.\nPatients with septal rupture frequently report chest pain, shortness of breath, and symptoms of low-output cardiogenic shock. Key physical findings include a harsh, loud holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border, palpable thrill at the right precordium, S 3 gallops, and accentuation of pulmonic component of the second heart sound. Color Doppler echocardiography is useful for determining the location and size of the defect and detecting left-to-right shunt and right ventricular overload. Septal rupture should be managed by temporary stabilization with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation followed by intravenous vasodilator and early surgical closure.\nFree-wall rupture usually leads to hemopericardium and abrupt circulatory collapse. Clinical manifestations range from anginal, pleuritic, or pericardial chest discomfort to catastrophic symptoms of cardiogenic shock, cardiac tamponade, and sudden death. Echocardiography is useful for the diagnosis and emergency pericardiocentesis may be indicated for cardiac tamponade. Survival depends primarily on early recognition and prompt surgical repair.\nNew onset atrial fibrillation in the setting of STEMI is associated with a very poor prognosis .

This includes both non-invasive and invasive modalities. Another modality used in hyperparathyroidism is dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). DXA is helpful in detecting low bone mineral density (BMD) caused by hyperparathyroidism.\nTechnetium-99m -methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-sestamibi or MIBI) scintigraphy is the most popular investigation for preoperative localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid glands.  Most of the sestamibi is retained in mitochondria of thyroid and abnormal parathyroid tissue and is a function of mitochondrial activity.  Single-isotope, double-phase technique is used. The basis of \"single-isotope, double-phase technique\" is that sestamibi washes out of the thyroid more rapidly than from abnormal parathyroid tissue.  Multiple planar images are obtained, typically one shortly after injection of 99mTc-sestamibi and another after two hours to identify the areas of retained sestamibi showing hyper-functioning parathyroid tissue. As all parathyroid lesions does not retain sestamibi nor all thyroid tissue washes out quickly, subtraction imaging may be beneficial.  Subtraction technique uses dual contrast Tc-99m sestamibi along with iodine-123 or 99m-technicium pertechnetate, which are taken by thyroid tissue only. Iodine-123/99m-technicium pertechnetate images of thyroid are later digitally subtracted from Tc-99m sestamibi images leading to visualization of parathyroid tissue only.  Presence of solid thyroid nodule is the most common cause of false positive results. Other causes of false positive results may include thyroid carcinoma, lymphoma, and lymphadenopathy. The sensitivity of sestamibi scintigraphy can be increased by using it concomitantly with neck ultrasound and/or SPECT.   The sensitivity of sestamibi scintigraphy is 80% - 90%.   \nFactors influencing sensitivity of Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy Factors Sensitivity Biochemical factors High serum calcium level  Increased High serum parathyroid hormone level   Increased Hypovitaminosis D  (only in primary hyperparathyroidism) Increased Calcium channel blocker use  (only in primary hyperparathyroidism) Decreased Gross and architectural factors Size (Large)   Increased Multi-glandular disease  Decreased Cytological factors Increased amount of cellular content   (Chief cells and oxyphil cells) Increased Immunohistochemical factors Increased P-glycoprotien expression  Decreased Note: P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a plasma membrane protein encoded by mammalian multidrug resistance gene (MDRI). Many drugs that are lipophilic and cationic at physiological pH interact with P-gp. Sestamibi is a lipophilic cationic on physioligical pH. P-gp acts as ATP-dependent efflux pump and prevents accumulation of sestamibi in parathyroid tissue. So, the uptake of sestamibi into parathyroid adenoma cells depends on the activity of the P-gp .\nSingle photon emission computed tomography may be used along with Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy for preoperative evaluation of hyper-functioning parathyroid gland.   Sestamibi-SPECT is also called pinhone-SPECT (P-SPECT). P-SPECT uses cone beam collimator in contrast to parallel-hole collimator used in SPECT. cone bean collimator possess more suitable geometric properties leading to high spatial resolution.   Using SPECT with sestamibi scintigraphy improves detection and localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid gland.   P-SPECT provides more precise result of sestamibi scitigraphy allowing surgeon to choose best route for surgical intervention. P-SPECT may detect glands not visible on planer images leading to increased sensitivity. It is very useful in case of uncertain result from conventional sestamibi scitigraphy.   P-SPECT also enables accurate interpretation sestamibi uptake in upper mediastinum leading to a higher specificity. In difficult cases, P-SPECT may also be adjuncted with subtraction Tc-99m sestamibi and I-123 scintigraphy or positron emission tomography.  P-SPECT is approximately 84% sensitive, 91% specific with positive predictive value of around 91% and negative predictive value of around 84%.  Fusion images of CT-MIBI-SPECT is superior to CT scan or MIBI-SPECT alone in preoperative localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid gland. \n11C-methionine PET along with CT scan (MET-PET/CT) may be used for preoperative localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid glands.   MET-PET/CT may be used as an complimentary imaging modality for localizing hyper-functioning parathyroid glands in patients with negative Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy / SPECT results. \nSelective transarterial hypocalcemic stimulation is combined with nonselective venous sampling to perform selective arteriography.  Sodium citrate is injected to induce hypocalcemia. Simultaneous arteriography is performed. Samples are taken for superior vena cava at basaeline and timed intervals (20 sec, 40 sec, and 60 sec). An increase in the parathyroid hormone level to 1.4 times above the baseline or a clear blush observed on arteriography is considered as positive localization. Arterial stimulation venous sampling is performed simultaneously with arteriogram due to similarly high PPV.\nSuperselective arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and superselective conventional angiography (CA) may be used for preoperative localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid glands in which noninvasive imaging modalities are negative or inconclusive.  Sensitivity of superselective digital subtraction angiography appears to be similar to conventional angiography. Superselective arterial digital subtraction angiography may be more sensitive than conventional angiography for preoperative localization of mediastinal hyper-functioning parathyroid glands.\nLow bone mineral density (BMD) is caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. Distal forearm is affected most commonly. DXA of distal forearm should be done in all patients of primary hyperparathyroidism. Very low T-score of distal forearm is observed in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the natural progression of Alstrom syndrome, its associated complications, and what is the expected prognosis?", "output": "Blindness Hearing loss Congestive heart failure Cirrhosis Pancreatitis ESRD Hypothyroidism Pulmonary fibrosis Portal hypertension Type 2 diabetes mellitus Stunted growth"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the definition of Clitoromegaly and how is it diagnosed?", "output": "In the most pronounced cases, clitoromegaly is a symptom of intersexuality since the large clitoris resembles a penis (the different grade of genital ambiguity is commonly measured by the Prader classification  ranging, in ascending order of masculinisation, from 1: Female external genitalia with clitoromegaly through 5: Pseudo-Phallus looking like normal male external genitalia )."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What does the term \"thyroid\" refer to?", "output": "Hypothyroidism (underactivity) Hashimoto's thyroiditis / thyroiditis Ord's thyroiditis Postoperative hypothyroidism Postpartum thyroiditis Silent thyroiditis Acute thyroiditis Iatrogenic hypothyroidism Hyperthyroidism (overactivity) Thyroid storm Graves-Basedow disease Toxic thyroid nodule Toxic nodular struma (Plummer's disease) Hashitoxicosis Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism De Quervain thyroiditis (inflammation starting as hyperthyroidism, can end as hypothyroidism)\nGoitre Endemic goitre Diffuse goitre Multinodular goitre Lingual thyroid Thyroglossal duct cyst\nThyroid adenoma Thyroid cancer Papillary Follicular Medullary Anaplastic Lymphomas and metastasis from elsewhere (rare)\nCretinism\nMedication linked to thyroid disease includes amiodarone, lithium salts, some types of interferon and IL-2."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the factors that put someone at risk for silent thyroiditis?", "output": "Common risk factors in the development of silent thyroiditis include lithium, radiation therapy in Hodgkin's lymphoma, cessation of corticosteroid s in Cushing's syndrome (post adrenalectomy), and certain autoimmune conditions.     \nCommon risk factors in the development of silent thyroiditis include:\nLithium Radiation therapy in Hodgkin's lymphoma Cessation of corticosteroids in Cushing's syndrome (post adrenalectomy)\nLess common risk factors in the development of silent thyroiditis include:\nSLE Immune thrombocytopenic purpura Lymphocytic hypophysitis"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What exactly is Asperger's syndrome?", "output": "Screening instruments for Asperger Syndrome include: Autism Screening Questionnaire (ASQ), Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Autism Spectrum Screening uestionnaire (ASSQ) and diagnostic instruments for Asperger Syndrome include: Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS), Gilliam Asperger\u2019s Disorder Scale (GADS) and Asperger Syndrome (and high-functioning autism) Diagnostic Interview (ASDI)."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "To what anomaly is Uhl referring?", "output": "Uhl anomaly is a very rare congenital heart disease with a partial or total loss of the myocardial muscle in the right ventricle."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What exactly is an endocardial cushion defect?", "output": "Based on the anatomical features and their impact on physiology, endocardial cushion defect may be classified into complete, partial, intermediate, transitional, and intermediate forms."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What does the term \"hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\" mean?", "output": "HSCT is associated with a high treatment-related mortality in the recipient (10% or higher), which limits its use to conditions that are themselves life-threatening. Major complications are veno-occlusive disease, mucositis, infections (sepsis) and graft-versus-host disease.\nBone marrow transplantation usually requires that the recipient's own bone marrow is destroyed (\"myeloablation\"). Prior to \"engraftment\" patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient at high risk of infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics, and accounts for a large share of treatment-related mortality. The immunosuppressive agents employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off of immunosuppressive medications.\nSevere liver injury is termed hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Elevated levels of bilirubin, hepatomegaly and fluid retention are clinical hallmarks of this condition. There is now a greater appreciation of the generalized cellular injury and obstruction in hepatic vein sinuses, and it has thus been referred to as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). Severe cases are associated with a high mortality. Anticoagulants or defibrotide may be effective in reducing the severity of VOD but may also increase bleeding complications. Ursodiol has been shown to help prevent VOD, presumably by helping the flow of bile.\nThe injury of the mucosal lining of the mouth and throat and is a common regimen-related toxicity following ablative HSCT regimens. It is usually not life-threatening but is very painful, and prevents eating and drinking. Mucositis is treated with pain medications plus intravenous infusions to prevent dehydration and malnutrition.\nGVHD is an inflammatory disease that is unique to allogeneic transplantation. It is an attack of the \"new\" bone marrow's immune cells against the recipient's tissues. This can occur even if the donor and recipient are HLA-identical because the immune system can still recognize other differences between their tissues. It is aptly named graft-versus-host disease because bone marrow transplantation is the only transplant procedure in which the transplanted cells must accept the body rather than the body accepting the new cells. Acute graft-versus-host disease typically occurs in the first 3 months after transplantation and may involve the skin, intestine, or the liver, and is often fatal. High-dose corticosteroids such as prednisone are a standard treatment; however this immuno-suppressive treatment often leads to deadly infections. Chronic graft-versus-host disease may also develop after allogeneic transplant. It is the major source of late treatment-related complications, although it less often results in death. In addition to inflammation, chronic graft-versus-host disease may lead to the development of fibrosis, or scar tissue, similar to scleroderma; it may cause functional disablity and require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. Graft-versus-host disease is usually mediated by T cells when they react to foreign peptides presented on the MHC of the host.\nThe beneficial aspect of the Graft-versus-Host phenomenon is known as the \"graft versus tumor\" or \"graft versus leukemia\" effect. For example, HCST patients with either acute and in particular chronic graft-versus-host disease after an allogeneic transplant tend to have a lower risk of cancer relapse  . This is due to a therapeutic immune reaction of the grafted donor lymphocytes, more specifically, the Natural Killer cells, against the diseased bone marrow of the recipient. This lower rate of relapse accounts for the increased success rate of allogeneic transplants compared to transplants from identical twins, and indicates that allogeneic HSCT is a form of immunotherapy. GVT is the major benefit of transplants which do not employ the highest immuno-suppressive regimens."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What does the curriculum for cardiac imaging entail?", "output": "Risk factors, primary prevention and screening Inducible myocardial ischemia Acute MI Chronic MI Post-MI complications Cardiac rupture LV aneurysm Papillary muscle rupture Congestive heart failure Dressler\u2019s syndrome Myocardial viability Stunned myocardium Hibernating myocardium Therapeutic and interventional options"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Can you provide an explanation of Dyspareunia, including its natural history, complications, and prognosis?", "output": "The symptom of dyspareunia is pain during intercourse/penetration, which could be either introital (at the vaginal entrance), deep (in the vagina or pelvis), or both.

These symptoms are quite different from, and should not be confused with, hypersexuality.\nTo establish, monitor, and regulate causation of PSSD in individual patients, one approach in use by consulation-liaison psychiatrists is to assay measurable parameters of patient health (hormone levels, sexual functioning) with a survey or laboratory tests before and after administering a psychiatric drug, based on individual patient concern regarding each of the listed side effects. If PSSD develops, a correlation can be established between assay results and PSSD, guiding further treatment for the individual patient and others. A lack of education on drug side effects and the presence of clinical depression in a patient who is a candidate for antidepressant therapy can combine to reduce the patient's ability to advocate for tests.\nPost-administration reporting of side effects provides useful data for development of new drugs and patient decisions.

There is an absence of one dominant atrial pacemaker. Variable or irregular PP intervals, RR intervals, and PR intervals (however, variation in PR intervals is not yet included in the diagnostic criteria because of the variation of PR interval depends on the length of the preceding RP interval).  Can be mistaken for atrial fibrillation if the p waves are of low amplitude.\nAs multifocal atrial tachycardia is mostly associated with the underlying medical conditions such as cardiac and pulmonary disease, so its diagnosis does not typically warrant any additional workup, other than the workup required for the suspected underlying conditions. If the arrhythmia persists despite of treating the underlying medical conditions, following tests should be done to check for any signs of infection, anemia, or electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia: Complete blood count Serum chemistry panel\nPediatric practitioners usually face the following four challenges regarding MAT in children:\nChallenges faced by pediatric practitioners while treating children with multifocal atrial tachycardia Challenges Details How to detect MAT early Early detection of MAT is very important in order to prevent the worse outcome in the case of infantile -onset MAT. Usually, tachycardia is first detected during the newborn period and the incidental detection of MAT not based on the clinical suspicion is rather high. Clinical suspicion of the infantile -onset of MAT is very important for its early detection. MAT lasting longer over several days without any proper management can lead to myocardial dysfunction which can further cause congestive heart failure due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Hence, it is necessary to detect MAT early and immediately treat it with appropriate management to prevent CHF. How to control MAT Complete control of the MAT is not easily achievable even with high- dose combinations of multiple antiarrhythmic medications. A more realistic treatment goal is to initially reduce the percentage of MAT by achieving ventricular rate control. Various drugs such as beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone have been used for the purpose, but there is not enough data to support the superiority of any one of these approaches. How deep to investigate etiologies of MAT  As there are many varieties of etiologies of MAT in children, these etiologies should be described in detail in order to treat the underlying problems and get a better clinical outcome. Idiopathic infantile -onset group shows a favorable outcome compared to the other groups such as syndromic disease. RASopathy has been reported to be associated with a high incidence of atrial arrhythmias hence, MAT in children should be checked for the association of RASopathy and vice versa. How to predict another arrhythmia and outcome     Atrial premature beats, atrial fibrillation (AF), or atrial flutter are known to accompany MAT in both adults and pediatric patients. MAT may be an early manifestation of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) with additional findings of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Phenotypical progression of MAT into CPVT and an association between the RyR2 mutation and AF and ectopic atrial tachycardia have been reported. MAT in young children may be the initial manifestation of a potentially life -threatening arrhythmia of CPVT. Hence, aggressive evaluations and close follow-ups might be required for the non- infantile form of MAT with a structurally normal heart.\nMostly patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia are asymptomatic. MAT is often incidentally found during the routine electrocardiogram. Once the diagnosis of MAT is made, a thorough history should be obtained with main focus on commonly associated conditions such as cardiac and pulmonary diseases particularly congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease respectively. The clinical manifestations of MAT differ from those of other tachyarrhythmias in that symptoms predominantly relate to the underlying precipitating illness rather than the arrhythmia itself. Patients usually present with: Irregular heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute (mostly identified only during the physical examination by the health care provider) Palpitations (rare) Presyncope (rare) Syncope (rare) Picture of a typical MAT patient is as follows:   Elderly patient Decompensated pulmonary disease Decompensated heart failure Postoperative Usually hemodynamically stable (no severe hemodynamic compromise associated with MAT) High mortality ECG features in MAT patients include: P waves with \u22653 forms Atrial rate usually 100 to 200 bpm Irregular atrial rate Variable PR interval Isoelectric baseline between P waves May progress to atrial fibrillation\nPhysical examination findings of patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia include: Elevated heart rate usually greater than 100 bpm Irregularly irregular rhythm Hemodynamically stable (mostly) As MAT is associated with underlying medical conditions, hence, it is suggested to carry out a general assessment for the signs of cardiopulmonary disease, especially because MAT can trigger the decompensation of underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is Erysipeloid and how is it categorized?", "output": "Erysipeloid may be classified into the following categories according to the severity of the condition: \nUsually a mild, localized infection Patients present with localized swelling and redness of the skin Commonly referred to as \"erysipeloid of Rosenbach\"\nPatients may present with fever\nManifests as bacteremia with associated complications (e.g., endocarditis, arthritis)"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the natural progression, potential complications, and outlook of Lyme disease?", "output": "Patients develops red, expanding rash called erythema migrans (EM).

This is not a sign that one has Lyme disease. However, ticks can spread other organisms that may cause a different type of rash. For example, Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) causes a rash with a very similar appearance. \nEM occurs in approximately 70-80% of infected persons and begins at the site of a tick bite after a delay of 3-30 days (average is about 7 days). Early EM may be homogenously erythematous without any central clearing.\nEM gradually expands over a period of several days, and can reach up to 12 inches (30 cm) across. Parts of the rash may clear as it enlarges, resulting in a bullseye appearance.\nThe rash usually feels warm to touch but is rarely itchy or painful.\nEM lesions may appear on any area of the body but is present the majority of the time on the axilla, inguinal region, or popliteal fossa. EM resolves in approximately 28 days in untreated patients. \nUntreated infection may spread from the site of the bite to other parts of the body, producing a range of symptoms including: Multiple EM lesions in other areas of the body. Multiple lesions are secondary to dissemination and are not to be confused with multiple tick bites  Facial or Bell's palsy Severe headaches and neck stiffness due to meningitis Pain and swelling in the large joints (such as knees) Shooting pains that may interfere with sleep Heart palpitations and dizziness due to changes in heartbeat\nMany of these symptoms will resolve over a period of weeks to months, even without treatment. However, lack of treatment can result in additional complications.\nLyme arthritis is the hallmark of stage 3 Lyme disease. Lyme arthritis is the most frequently presented symptom in late disseminated Lyme disease. Lyme arthritis is not necessarily preceded by erythema migrans. Approximately 60% of patients with untreated infection may begin to have intermittent attacks of arthritis with severe joint pain and swelling.  Intermittent attacks of Lyme arthritis range from 3 days to 11.5 months with a mean of 3 months.  During early years of illness, attacks of Lyme arthritis are more frequent and longer in duration. Both frequency and duration of attacks subsequently decrease. There may be months or years of complete remission between each attack of Lyme arthritis. The majority of the time, Lyme arthritis involves large joints. The most commonly affected joint is knee joint, but any joint can be affected including the shoulder, ankle, elbow, temporomandibular joint, and wrist. Lyme arthritis manifests differently than other causes of arthritis and must be distinguished from other causes of arthralgias.

Processes which can damage the peripheral nerves at multiple levels via many molecular pathways include: Immunologic, metabolic, genetic, infectious, toxic and traumatic processes. Any pathologic process affecting the cell body will result in downstream degeneration of the cell's axon. Primary motor neuron diseases, such as ALS or SMA, demonstrate axonal pathology peripherally when central neurons degenerate. Similarly, metabolic conditions, such as diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, nutritional deficiencies, or chronic renal failure, affect DRG cell bodies by mechanisms involving insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Pathologic damage may also be considered to take place directly at the axon, independent of the cell body. Schwann cells and the myelin sheath are often selectively targeted in immune-mediated processes such as GBS, CIDP, paraproteinemias, and their variants. It is theorized that a phenomenon of molecular mimicry occurs in these diseases, wherein glycoprotein epitopes found in myelin bear structural similarity to those found in other infectious agents. Immune recognition of these pathogens then spreads to include normal epitopes on the myelin sheath. Pathologic studies reveal both humoral and cellular immune activation and lymphocytic infiltration with patchy demyelination and remyelination. A number of GBS variants which are more prevalent in Asia and Central/South America also damage axons along with myelin, and are commonly associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection. Hereditary neuropathies can also affect both axons and/or their myelin sheaths. The most common type, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), is classified into many clinical subtypes. Many other genetic syndromes also produce varying disruption of Schwann cell, axon and/or neuronal function.

The use of electric light was a major step in the improvement of endoscopy. The first such lights were external. Later, smaller bulbs became available making internal light possible, for instance in a hysteroscope by Charles David in 1908. Hans Christian Jacobaeus has been given credit for early endoscopic explorations of the abdomen and the thorax with laparoscopy (1912) and thoracoscopy (1910). Laparoscopy was used in the diagnosis of liver and gallbladder disease by Heinz Kalk in the 1930s. Hope reported in 1937 on the use of laparoscopy to diagnose ectopic pregnancy. In 1944, Raoul Palmer placed his patients in the Trendelenburg position after gaseous distention of the abdomen and thus was able to reliably perform gynecologic laparoscopy.\nThe first gastrocamera was released in 1950 by Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. The device took pictures on monochromatic film using a small light bulb that was triggered manually. The device was of limited use, however, because it did not implement real-time optical capability. Olympus continued its development of endoscopes by incorporating fiber optics in the early 1960s, leading to the first useful endoscopes. In 1964, it released a gastrocamera guided by a fiberscope.  A few articles claim that Dr.Basil Hirschowitz of Univ.Of Michigan,Ann Arbor discussed the endoscope in early 50's. \nAs endoscopic technology improved, so did the methods of gastrointestinal endoscopy. Owing primarily to the efforts of Dr. Hiromi Shinya in the late 1960s, GI endoscopy developed into what is more recognizable as today's colonoscopy. While many doctors experimented with techniques to take advantage of the new iterations of endoscopes, Dr. Shinya focused on techniques that would allow for successful operation of the endoscope by an individual, rejecting the common practice at the time of utilizing two people. Consequently, many of the fundamental methods and procedures of modern colonoscopy were developed by Dr. Shinya.\nDr. Shinya's other great contribution was to therapeutic endoscopy, in his invention of the electrosurgical polypectomy snare with the aid of Olympus employee Hiroshi Ichikawa. Shinya sketched his first plans for the device on January 8, 1969. He envisioned a loop of wire attached to the end of a colonoscope that would allow for easy removal of polyps during investigation by passing a current through the wire. By September of 1969, the first polypectomy using this device was performed. Polypectomy has since become the most common therapeutic procedure performed with an endoscope. Template:Wikiref\nBy 1980, laparoscopy training was required by gynecologists to perform tubal ligation procedures and diagnostic evaluations of the pelvis. The first laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 1984 and the first video-laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987. During the 1990s, laparoscopic surgery was extended to the appendix, spleen, colon, stomach, kidney, and liver.

Osteosarcoma is the most common type of malignant bone cancer, accounting for 35% of primary bone malignancies. It is a malignant tumor that is characterized by the direct formation of bone or osteoid tissue by the tumor cells. Malignant tumors that begin in bone tissue are called primary bone cancer. Osteosarcoma may be classified according to the World Health Organization \u2019s histologic classification of bone tumors into three groups. The osteosarcomas may be localized at the end of the long bones (commonly in the metaphysis). Most often it affects the upper end of the tibia, humerus, or lower end of the femur. On gross pathology, areas of bone formation, hemorrhage, fibrosis, and cystic degeneration on cut surface are characteristic findings of osteosarcoma. On microscopic histopathological analysis, presence of osteoid within the tumor, pleomorphic cells, anaplastic cells, and atypical mitoses are characteristic findings of osteosarcoma. There are no established causes for osteosarcoma. The common risk factors in the development of osteosarcoma are radiation to bones, alkylating antineoplastic agents, Paget disease, multiple hereditary osteochondromas, fibrous dysplasia, Bloom syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Common complications of osteosarcoma include pathologic fracture and metastasis. The most common symptoms of osteosarcoma include bone pain that may be worse at night, swelling, and redness at the site of the tumor. On x-ray, osteosarcoma is characterized by medullary and cortical bone destruction, periosteal reaction, tumor matrix calcification, and soft tissue mass. On MRI, osteosarcoma is characterized by intermediate intensity of soft tissue and low signal intensity of ossified components on T1. High signal intensity of soft tissue and low signal intensity of ossified components on T2. The predominant therapy for osteosarcoma is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery) followed by surgical resection. The most common drugs used to treat osteosarcoma are cisplatin, doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the criteria used for diagnosing molluscum contagiosum?", "output": "Histologic examination can confirm the clinical diagnosis. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of a molluscum contagiosum lesion will reveal cells and keratinocytes containing eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that are also known as molluscum bodies or Henderson-Paterson bodies.\nDermoscopic examination can also be useful for supporting a clinical diagnosis and confirmation of molluscum contagiosum. In dermoscopic exam, a central umbilication with polylobular, white to yellow amorphous structures will be visualized which is typical for the disease. This exam allows physicians to evaluate primary morphology of skin lesions.  \nIn dermoscopic exam a peripheral crown of radiating or punctiform vessels may also be seen. Dermoscopy exams of molluscum contagiosum lesions provide a higher specificity for the disease than other diagnostic methods. The presence of vessels, orifices, and specific vascular patterns helps in determining the diagnosis and in differentiating molluscum contagiosum from other diseases. \nElectron microscopy of biopsies is not usually indicated due to the cost and feasibility, but if done, will demonstrate typical brick-shaped poxvirus particles.

Mutations in the NF1 gene result in loss of production or reduced function of protein; this causes a wide spectrum of clinical findings, including NF1 -associated tumors.   Histopathologically, Lisch nodules are composed of melanocytes and spindle cells, usually concentrated on the superficial layers of the iris stroma.    The spindle cells are larger than the normal iris melanocytes.

Raynaud's phenomenon Shock Superior vena cava syndrome Thromboembolism"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you explain what the gastrocolic reflex refers to?", "output": "The gastrocolic reflex or gastrocolic response is one of a number of physiological reflexes controlling the motility, or peristalsis, of the gastrointestinal tract. It involves an increase in motility of the colon in response to stretch in the stomach and byproducts of digestion in the small intestine. The small intestine also shows a similar motility response.\nThe reflex was demonstrated by myoelectric recordings in the colons of animals and humans, which showed an increase in electrical activity within as little as 15 minutes after eating. The recordings also demonstrated that the gastrocolic reflex is uneven in its distribution throughout the colon. The sigmoid colon is more greatly affected than the right side of the colon in terms of a phasic response; however, the tonic response across the colon is uncertain. A number of neuropeptides have been proposed as mediators of the gastrocolic reflex. These include serotonin, neurotensin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and gastrin.\nClinically, the gastrocolic reflex has been implicated in pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome. Also, the serotonin (5HT 3) antagonist ondansetron decreases the tonic response to stretch."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What exactly is ovarian sarcoma?", "output": "There are no established measures for the secondary prevention of ovarian sarcoma."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Can you provide a summary of pneumomediastinum?", "output": "Pneumomediastinum is considered a benign entity with good prognosis.

There also have been incidences of recurrence."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you please explain what Superior vena cava syndrome is?", "output": "If left untreated, patients with superior vena cava syndrome may progress to develop a complete blood flow obstruction and a decreased cardiac output with hypotension, leading to heart failure and death. Common complications of superior vena cava syndrome include airway obstruction, increased ICP, laryngeal edema, and cerebral edema. The prognosis will vary depending on the cause of the syndrome, and the amount of blockage that has already occurred. Prognosis is generally poor and the survival rate of patients with superior vena cava syndrome is approximately 10-20% at 6 months."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the anatomy and underlying mechanisms of mitral stenosis?", "output": "When the mitral valve area goes below 2 cm 2, the valve causes an impediment to the flow of blood into the left ventricle, creating a pressure gradient across the mitral valve. This gradient may be increased by increases in the heart rate or cardiac output. As the gradient across the mitral valve increases, the amount of time necessary to fill the left ventricle with blood increases. Eventually, the left ventricle requires the atrial kick to fill with blood. As the heart rate increases, the amount of time that the ventricle is in diastole and can fill up with blood (called the diastolic filling period) decreases. When the heart rate goes above a certain point, the diastolic filling period is insufficient to fill the ventricle with blood and pressure builds up in the left atrium, leading to pulmonary congestion.\nWhen the mitral valve area goes less than 1 cm 2, there will be an increase in the left atrial pressures (required to push blood through the stenotic valve). Since the normal left ventricular diastolic pressures is about 5 mmHg, a pressure gradient across the mitral valve of 20 mmHg due to severe mitral stenosis will cause a left atrial pressure of about 25 mmHg. This left atrial pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature and causes pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary capillary pressures in this level cause an imbalance between the hydrostatic pressure and the oncotic pressure, leading to extravasation of fluid from the vascular tree and pooling of fluid in the lungs (congestive heart failure causing pulmonary edema).\nIncreases in the heart rate will allow less time for the left ventricle to fill, also causing an increase in left atrial pressure and pulmonary congestion.\nThe constant pressure overload of the left atrium will cause the left atrium to increase in size. As the left atrium increases in size, it becomes more prone to develop atrial fibrillation. When atrial fibrillation develops, the atrial kick is lost (since it is due to the normal atrial contraction).\nIn individuals with severe mitral stenosis, the left ventricular filling is dependent on the atrial kick. The loss of the atrial kick due to atrial fibrillation can cause a precipitous decrease in cardiac output and sudden congestive heart failure.\nThe mitral annulus changes in shape and size during the cardiac cycle. It is smaller at the end of atrial systole due to the contraction of the left atrium around it, like a sphincter. This reduction in annulus size at the end of atrial systole may be important for the proper coapting of the leaflets of the mitral valve when the left ventricle contracts and pumps blood .\nThe closing of the mitral valve and the tricuspid valve constitutes the first heart sound (S1). It is not actually the valve closure which produces a sound but rather the sudden cessation of blood flow caused by the closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves. The mitral valve opening is normally not heard except in mitral stenosis as the opening Snap. Flow of blood into the heart during rapid filling is not normally heard except in certain pathological states where it constitutes the third heart sound (S3).\nThickening and immobility of the mitral valve leaflets causes an obstruction in blood flow from the left atrium to left ventricle (Mitral stenosis). As a result, the pressure in the left atrium increases, also the pressure in the pulmonary vasculature and right side of the heart increases. Mitral stenosis may cause left ventricular dysfunction if it is associated with mitral regurgitation .\nAlmost all cases of mitral stenosis are due to disease in the heart secondary to rheumatic fever and the consequent rheumatic heart disease (a condition that may develop after strep throat or scarlet fever). Around 90% of cases of rheumatic heart disease are associated with mitral stenosis . The valve problems develop 5 - 10 years after the rheumatic fever, a tiny nodules forms along the valve leaflets , the leaflets eventually thicken with deposition of fibrin. The cusps may become fibrosed, calcified and thickened over a span of a decade  . Chronic turbulent flow through a deformed valve appears to cause these changes and as a result the valve losses it's normal morphology . The degree of leaflet thickening and calcification and the severity of chordal involvement are variable. Rheumatic fever is becoming rare in the United States, so mitral stenosis is also less common  .\nSeverity of Mitral stenosis\nThe severity of mitral stenosis depends on the pressure gradient between the left atrium and ventricle which depends on the cross sectional area of the mitral valve. The normal mitral valve orifice has a cross sectional area of about 4.0 cm2.\nMitral stenosis is mild if the cross sectional area is about 2 cm2 and the pressure gradient is small. Mitral stenosis is moderate if the cross sectional area is about 1.0 to 1.5 cm2. Mitral stenosis is severe if the cross sectional area is \u22641.0 cm2 and the pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle is significant.\nUsually, the rate of decrement in the valve area is about 0.1 cm2/year once mitral stenosis is present  .\nIn pregnancy, the pressure gradient between the left atrium and ventricle is usually increased due to the increase in the heart rate and cardiac output during pregnancy. This can lead to the diagnosis of previously asymptomatic case of mitral stenosis, or worsening of the symptoms of previously diagnosed case."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the explanation for the relationship between ARVD1, epidemiology, and demographics?", "output": "The incidence of ARVD is about 1/10,000 in the general population in the United States, although some studies have suggested that it may be as common as 1/1,000. It accounts for up to 17% of all sudden cardiac deaths in the young. In Italy, the incidence is 40/10,000, making it the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young population. It is more common in Northern Italy.\nThe male to female ratio is 3:1."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you please tell me the definition of pulmonic regurgitation?", "output": "Pulmonary valve is located at the junction of the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary artery. Three equal-sized, semilunar cusps or leaflets make up the pulmonary valve. Pulmonary valve opens during right ventricular systole and closes during right ventricular diastole. Pulmonary regurgitation (PR) may be caused by an acquired alteration in the valvular morphology, idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery (IDPA), pulmonic valve ring dilatation, congenital absence or malformation of the valve, and increasing regurgitation causing right ventricular volume overload. The pathophysiologic mechanism of pulmonic regurgitation includes right ventricular overload resulting in the right ventricular remodeling and progressive decline in function. The rate of decline in right ventricular systolic function is affected by associated conditions such as peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis and pulmonary hypertension which further increase the severity of pulmonary regurgitation. Among patients with severe PR, the gene expression pattern of GRK2 and \u03b22- adrenoceptor (molecular markers of cardiac dysfunction) has been reported to be altered. Isolated PR is uncommon and is usually demonstrated with other valvular abnormalities or in certain conditions. Conditions associated include TOF, rheumatic heart disease and syphilis.

Medications may attenuate remodeling. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been consistently shown to decrease remodeling in animal models or transmural infarction and chronic pressure overload. Clinical trials have shown that ACE inhibitor therapy after myocardial infarction leads to improved myocardial performance, improved ejection fraction, and decreased mortality compared to patients treated with placebo. Early correction of congenital heart defects, if appropriate, may prevent remodeling, as will treatment of chronic hypertension or valvular heart disease. Often, reverse remodeling, or improvement in left ventricular function, will also be seen."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What does the term \"hyperkalemic periodic paralysis\" mean?", "output": "Although much rarer, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis has also been observed in humans. In humans the disorder causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness, usually beginning in the second decade and depending on the type and severity of the HYPP will increase or stabilize until the fourth or fifth decade where attacks usually decline and can altogether stop. Factors that can trigger attacks include rest after exercise, potassium-rich foods, stress, fatigue, certain pollutants (eg: Cigarette smoke) and periods of fasting. Muscle strength improves between attacks, although many affected people may have increasing bouts of muscle weakness as time goes on (abortive attacks). Sometimes with HYPP those affected may experience degrees of muscle stiffness and spasms (myotonia) in the affected muscles. This can be caused by the same things that trigger the paralysis, dependant on the type of mytonia. (See also paramyotonia).\nSome people with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis have increased levels of potassium in their blood (hyperkalemia) during attacks. In other cases, attacks are associated with normal blood potassium levels (normokalemia). Ingesting potassium can trigger attacks in affected individuals, even if blood potassium levels do not go up.\nThe most common underlying cause is one of several possible point mutations in the gene SCN4A. The SCN4A gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain positively charged atoms (ions), including sodium, into muscle cells. The SCN4A protein forms channels that control the flow of sodium ions into these cells. Mutations in the SCN4A gene alter the usual structure and function of sodium channels. The altered channels cannot properly regulate the flow of sodium ions into muscle cells, which reduces the ability of skeletal muscles to contract. Because muscle contraction is needed for movement, a disruption in normal ion transport leads to episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis.\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you provide me the existing text, so I can rephrase it?", "output": "Vachel and Stevens were the first to describe a case of cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts in 1906, but Jacques Caroli in 1958 gave a more thorough description of a syndrome of congenital malformation of the intrahepatic ducts with segmental cystic dilatation, increased biliary lithiasis, cholangitis and liver abscesses, associated with renal cystic disease or tubular ectasia.

The evaluation of a patient with acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis consists of history and physical examination and urine culture for lower urinary tract localization cultures, respectively. The evaluation of chronic pelvic pain syndrome includes tests which can be broadly divided into mandatory, recommended and optional.\nA detailed and thorough history from the patient is necessary. Specific areas of focus when obtaining a history from the patient include previous history of sexually transmitted diseases, any new sexual partners, known urogenital disorders, and recent catheterization or other genitourinary instrumentation.

Symptoms of acute prostatitis may also include fever, nausea, and vomiting. \nPatients with chronic prostatitis are usually well-appearing. Patients with acute prostatitis may appear ill and have systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and nausea.   In acute prostatitis, palpation of the prostate reveals a tender and enlarged prostate.   In chronic prostatitis, palpation of the prostate reveals a tender and soft (boggy) prostate gland.  A prostate massage should never be done in a patient with suspected acute prostatitis, since it may induce sepsis.\nThe laboratory tests used in the diagnosis of prostatitis are CBC, urinalysis, serum PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels, urine culture, postvoid residual volume levels, 2-glass pre and post-prostatic massage test, Stamey-Meares four-glass test, and a semen analysis.    Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of acute prostatitis include increased leukocytes on complete blood picture, bacteria seen on urine culture, elevated C-reactive protein, and transiently elevated PSA (prostate specific antigen) levels. Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of chronic bacterial prostatitis include negative pre-massage urine culture results, more than 10 to 20 leukocytes per high-power field in both the pre and the post massage urine specimen, bacteriuria in the postmassage urine specimen, and lower leukocyte and bacterial counts in voided bladder urine specimens as compared to bacterial count in post-prostatic massage voided urine or expressed prostatic secretions.   The absence of bacterial growth on cultures is diagnostic of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis. \nCT scan in a patient with prostatitis shows edema of the prostate gland with diffuse enlargement, mostly in the peripheral zone. An abscess may be seen as a rim enhancing hypodensity which can either have single or multiple loci. Ultrasound can be used to diagnose prostatitis. On ultrasonography, focal hypoechoic area in the periphery of the prostate represents prostatitis. Fluid collection can show abscess formation. Colour doppler ultrasound may also prove to be very effective. MRI can also be used to diagnose prostatitis. Though it is not used commonly, its utilisation when suspecting alternate diagnosis like prostatic carcinoma etc is very important. MRI in case of a patient wit prostatitis depicts diffuse enlargement of the gland."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What laboratory findings are typically connected with Pneumoconiosis?", "output": "There are no diagnostic laboratory findings associated with pneumoconiosis.

Although blood fills the chambers of the heart, the muscle tissue of the heart, or myocardium, is so thick that it requires coronary blood vessels to deliver blood deep into it. There are two primary arteries supplying the heart, the left coronary artery and the right coronary artery. These two epicardial coronary arteries course along the surface of the heart and this is why they are called \"epicardial\" (on top of the heart) arteries. Smaller arteries dive deep into the heart muscle and are called subendocardial coronary arteries.

It is sometimes used as a primary treatment option for younger people who have an HLA -matched donor. It is a treatment option for some people who do not achieve a complete response or develop resistance to or relapse with imatinib.\nAllogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative treatment option that comes at the cost of increased toxicity.\nA reduced intensity transplant may be an option for older people who may not tolerate a standard transplant. The chemotherapy or radiation used to prepare for a stem cell transplant is less intense than that used for a standard allogeneic transplant.\nOutcomes with HCT and tyrosine kinase inhibitors have not been directly compared in a well-designed trial. However, based on historical comparisons, HCT is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, despite the possibility of cure. Thus, allogeneic HCT is currently not offered as initial therapy, except in rare circumstances.\nWith HCT, the probability of survival can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using a scoring system devised by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.  The five-year overall survival rates for patients in the best risk groups ranged from 60 to 80 percent. As an example, a prospective trial of HCT in patients in first chronic phase, most of whom had failed to respond to initial treatment with imatinib, reported a transplant-related mortality rate of 8 percent. \nThe aim of initial therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is to achieve the milestones, which are optimal responses proposed by the European LeukemiaNet.

A decision to change therapy must also take into consideration the trends in these values over time. Discontinuation of a TKI would be an option for only the approximately 15 to 20 percent of patients who achieve sustained non-detectable levels of BCR/ABL1 for at least two years; successful long-term discontinuation of therapy would be expected in less than 10 to 15 percent of newly diagnosed patients. \nFor individuals who have had a deep molecular remission, about half will have evidence of molecular recurrence and progression within one year after discontinuing TKI therapy, since viable CML stem cells can remain in a quiescent state in the marrow.  . In general, the patients who are most likely to maintain a long treatment-free remission are those who have had the longest period of TKI treatment and have had undetectable transcript levels for years.\nBiological therapy may be offered for chronic stage CML. Biological therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The most common biological therapy used is interferon alfa (Intron A, Roferon A).

See a cardiologist every 3 to 6 months. Surgery: Surgery to repair or replace the aortic valve is the preferred treatment for adults or children who develop symptoms. Even if symptoms are not very bad, the doctor may recommend surgery. People with no symptoms but worrisome results on diagnostic tests may also require surgery. Valvuloplasty: Some high-risk patients may be poor candidates for heart valve surgery. A less invasive procedure called balloon valvuloplasty may be done in adults or children instead. This is a procedure in which a balloon is placed into an artery in the groin, advanced to the heart, placed across the valve, and inflated. This may relieve the obstruction caused by the narrowed valve. Percutaneous Aortic Valve Replacement: Percutaneous aortic valvular replacement (PAVR) is a new less invasive procedure that does not require open heart surgery. In this procedure, a new replacement or prosthetic valve is implanted into the heart. The device is inserted through a small hole in the artery that runs to the leg . It is a relatively new procedure and is currently under study. It has the benefits of not requiring general anesthesia, causing less pain, less blood loss, and a lower risk of infection. There is also a faster recovery after PAVR than with traditional open heart surgery to replace the aortic valve.\nIn children, treatments include:\nPhysically activity limits: Children with mild aortic stenosis may be able to participate in most activities and sports. As the illness progresses, sports such as golf and baseball may be permitted, but not more physically demanding activities. Surgery: Valvuloplasty is often the first-choice for surgery in children.

The first triplet disease to be identified was fragile X syndrome that has since been mapped to the long arm of the X chromosome. At this point, there are from 230 to 4000 CGG repeats in the gene that causes fragile X syndrome in these patients, as compared with 60 to 230 repeats in carriers and 5 to 54 repeats in normal persons. The chromosomal instability resulting from this trinucleotide expansion presents clinically as mental retardation, distinctive facial features, and macroorchidism in males. The second, related DNA-triplet repeat disease, fragile X-E syndrome, was also identified on the X chromosome, but was found to be the result of an expanded GCC repeat. Identifying trinucleotide repeats as the basis of disease has brought clarity to our understanding of a complex set of inherited neurological diseases.\nAs more repeat expansion diseases have been discovered, several categories have been established to group them based upon similar characteristics. Category I includes Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) and the spinocerebellar ataxias that are caused by a CAG repeat expansion in protein-coding portions of specific genes. Category II expansions tend to be more phenotypically diverse with heterogeneous expansions that are generally small in magnitude, but also found in the exons of genes. Category III includes fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, two of the spinocerebellar ataxias, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Friedreich ataxia. These diseases are characterized by typically much larger repeat expansions than the first two groups, and the repeats are located outside of the protein-coding regions of the genes.\nCurrently, ten neurologic disorders are known to be caused by an increased number of CAG repeats, typically in coding regions of otherwise unrelated proteins. During protein synthesis, the expanded CAG repeats are translated into a series of uninterrupted glutamine residues forming what is known as a polyglutamine tract. Such polyglutamine tracts may be subject to increased aggregation.\nRecent results suggest that the CAG repeats need not always be translated in order to cause toxicity. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania demonstrated that in fruit flies, a protein previously known to bind CUG repeats (muscleblind, or mbl) is also capable of binding CAG repeats. Furthermore, when the CAG repeat was changed to a repeating series of CAACAG (which also translates to polyQ), toxicity was dramatically reduced.</ref> The human homolog of mbl, MBNL1, which was originally identified as binding CUG repeats in RNA , has since been shown to bind CAG   (and CCG ) repeats as well.\nThese disorders are characterized by autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (with the exception of spino-bulbar muscular atrophy which shows X-linked inheritance), midlife onset, a progressive course, and a correlation of the number of CAG repeats with the severity of disease and the age at onset. Family studies have also suggested that these diseases are associated with anticipation, the tendency for progressively earlier or more severe expression of the disease in successive generations. Although the causative genes are widely expressed in all of the known polyglutamine diseases, each disease displays an extremely selective pattern of neurodegeneration.\nClick on section title for internal link to a thorough list\nAutosomal Dominant Several spinal cerebellar atrophies Huntington's Disease - CAG Myotonic Dystrophy - CTG\nAutosomal Recessive Friedreich Ataxia - GAA\nX-Linked Fragile X syndrome - CGG"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What exactly is a Lisch nodule?", "output": "The incidence of Lisch nodules is approximately 1 in 2600 to 3000 individuals worldwide.

MODY was originally applied to any child or young adult who had persistent, asymptomatic hyperglycemia without progression to diabetic ketoacidosis or ketoacidosis. In retrospect we can now recognize that this category covered a heterogeneous collection of disorders which included cases of dominantly inherited diabetes (the topic of this article, still called MODY today), as well as cases of what we would now call type 2 diabetes occurring in childhood or adolescence, and a few even rarer types of hyperglycemia (e.g., mitochondrial diabetes or mutant insulin). Many of these patients were treated with sulfonylureas with varying degrees of success.\nBy the 1990s, as the understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes has improved, the concept and usage of \"MODY\" have become refined and narrower. It is now used as a synonym for dominantly inherited, monogenic defects of insulin secretion occurring at any age, and no longer includes any forms of type 2 diabetes."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the primary method of preventing esophageal stricture?", "output": "Effective measures for the primary prevention of esophageal stricture include:\nTreatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists as a most important cause of esophageal stricture   Life style modification for gastroesophageal reflux disease such as avoiding: Spicy foods Tobacco Alcohol Peppermint Chocolate Food before bedtime Take pills with a full glass of water in an upright position in order to prevent pill-induced esophagitis as a cause of esophageal stricture.

Report cases (in accordance with local requirements) to public health and initiate partner services. Provide prevention counseling to persons with diagnosed HIV infection. Ensure all persons with HIV infection are informed that if they achieve and maintain a suppressed viral load, they have effectively no risk for transmitting HIV. Stress that a suppressed viral load is not a substitute for condoms and behavioral modifications because ART does not protect persons with HIV against other STIs. Provide additional counseling, either on-site or through referral, about the psychosocial and medical implications of having HIV infection. Assess the need for immediate medical care and psychosocial support. Link persons with diagnosed HIV infection to services provided by health care personnel experienced in managing HIV infection. Additional services that might be needed include substance misuse counseling and treatment, treatment for mental health disorders or emotional distress, reproductive counseling, risk-reduction counseling, and case management. Providers should follow up to ensure that patients have received services for any identified needs. Persons with HIV infection should be educated about the importance of ongoing medical care and what to expect from these services."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What information pertains to boiling?", "output": "Boils may heal on their own after a period of itching and mild pain. More often, they increase in discomfort as pus collects.\nBoils usually must open and drain before they will heal. This usually occurs in less than 2 weeks.\nWarm, moist compresses help boils drain, which speeds healing. Gently soak the area with a warm, moist cloth several times each day. Never squeeze a boil or try to cut it open at home. This can spread the infection and make it worse. When the boil finally does burst and drain, continue to put warm, wet compresses on the area.\nDeep or large boils may need to be drained with surgery by a health care provider. Treatment by a health care provider is needed if:\nA boil lasts longer than 2 weeks A boil comes back The boil is on the spine or the middle of the face The boil occurs with a fever or other symptoms, because the infection may spread and cause complications\nCareful hygiene is important:\nClean draining boils often. Wash your hands very well after touching a boil. Do not re-use or share washcloths or towels. Wash clothing, washcloths, towels, and sheets or other items that contact infected areas in very hot (preferably boiling) water. Change dressings often and throw them out with the drainage, such as by placing them in a bag that can be closed tightly before throwing it out.\nAntibacterial soaps and antibiotics placed on the skin are of little help once a boil has formed.

Nonspecific fatigue or pain syndromes such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and Overtraining Syndrome are all collections of symptoms, one of likely to be exercise intolerance.\nHeart block Junctional bradycardia\nExercise intolerance can also be caused by specific health conditions, such as heart conditions or conditions that cause back pain. Several heart conditions, such as a cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heart rate or rhythm) or an aortic valve insufficiency, if severe enough can cause activity problems such as shortness of breath and/or exercise intolerance. People with acute back pain from an injury or chronic back pain (e.g., from a degenerative condition) may also experience exercise limitations due to muscle spasms or limited range of spinal motion. Exercise is key for many heart and back patients, and a variety of specific exercise techniques are available for both groups. Some exercise specialists (e.g., physical therapists, athletic trainers) are trained in modifications specific to these patients.\nCertain conditions in particular exist where exercise, particularly rehabilitation, may be contraindicated, including:\ndecompensated heart failure recent MI hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy from recent myocarditis active or suspected myocarditis or pericarditis low left ventricular ejection fraction severe aortic stenosis unstable ischemia unstable arrhythmia irregular or resting pulse greater than 100 bpm resting systolic blood pressure >200 mm Hg or resting diastolic blood pressure >110 mm Hg severe pulmonary hypertension suspected or known dissecting aneurysm recent systemic or pulmonary embolus pneumothorax and haemoptysis thrombophlebitis\nOther conditions may also preclude exercising under certain conditions.

Additionally, patients with orbital cellulitis often have a recent history of rhinosinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, facial insect bite, orbital surgery or trauma, tooth abscess, or otitis media.      \nPatients with orbital cellulitis usually appear ill. Physical examination of patients with orbital cellulitis is usually remarkable for fever, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and impaired visual acuity. Patients should undergo a complete physical examination, paying particular attention to general appearance, vital signs, visual acuity, visual field, orbital positioning, ocular movmements, oropharynx, and nasopharynx examinations.      \nThere are no diagnostic lab findings associated with orbital cellulitis. Some patients with orbital cellulitis may have elevated ESR, CRP, and white blood cells with a left shift. These are non-specific findings associated with infections, inflammatory conditions and some neoplasia.  Blood and nasal mucosal cultures are often ordered to help guide medical therapy, though they have low positive and negative predictive values, and thus do not contribute to diagnosis of orbital cellulitis.\nThere are no diagnostic x ray findings associated with orbital cellulitis. In cases where CT scan is contraindicated, plain radiograph (x ray) is indicated prior to MRI in patients with a suspected history of metallic object ocular trauma.  \nComputed tomography of the orbit is the imaging modality of choice for patients with orbital cellulitis. On CT scan of the head, orbital cellulitis is characterized by hyperdensity within low density periorbital fat and generalized elevation of the periobital space. CT is also diagnostic of subperiosteal and orbital abscesses associated with orbital cellulitis.      \nMRI has demonstrated equivalence to CT in diagnosing orbital disease and is also accepted as a gold standard diagnostic imaging modality.   On MRI scan of the head, orbital cellulitis is characterized by hypointense signal on T1 -weighted fat-suppressed images, and hyperintense signal on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images.  Although an MRI scan is safer in children since there is no risk of radiation exposure, the long acquisition time and the need for prolonged sedation make CT scan the imaging modality of choice.  \nThere are no ultrasound findings specifically associated with orbital cellulitis. Ultrasound can detect an abscess in the anterior orbit or medial orbital wall with high sensitivity.

The disease is chronic and slowly progressive. The exact pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis is not fully understood. It is postulated that primary biliary cirrhosis is the result of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), directed to the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2). Overexpression of Bcl-2 in small apoptotic biliary epithelial cells and cell lineage-specific lack of glutathione prevents loss of immunogenicity of the PDC-E2 component after apoptosis of biliary epithelial cells which finally results in autoimmunity. Primary biliary cirrhosis may be familial and is related to factors inherited maternally. Primary biliary cirrhosis is strongly associated with a variety of rheumatologic conditions, most commonly Sjogren's syndrome. On gross pathology, characteristic findings of primary biliary cirrhosis include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and cirrhosis (in late stage). On microscopic histopathological analysis, asymmetric destruction of the intralobular bile ducts within portal triads is characteristic findings of primary biliary cirrhosis. It is important to differentiate PBC from other disease that may cause cholestasis including autoimmune hepatitis, common bile duct stone, hepatitis A (choelstatic type), EBV or CMV hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, pre-ampullary cancers, AIDS cholangiopathy, parasites induced cholestasis, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is sexual dysfunction caused by SSRI?", "output": "One or more of the following sexual symptoms persist or begin after the discontinuation of SSRIs.\nDecreased or absent libido Impotence or reduced vaginal lubrication Difficulty initiating or maintaining an erection or becoming aroused Persistent sexual arousal syndrome despite absence of desire Muted, delayed or absent orgasm (anorgasmia) Reduced or no experience of pleasure during orgasm (ejaculatory anhedonia) Premature ejaculation Weakened penile, vaginal or clitoral sensitivity Genital anesthesia Loss or decreased response to sexual stimuli Reduced semen volume Priapism"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "How are electrocardiogram readings related to type 1 diabetes mellitus?", "output": "There are no ECG findings associated with diabetes mellitus type 1."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you explain the meaning of neonatal jaundice?", "output": "According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, screening tests recommended for neonatal jaundice include blood typing, clinical assessment of jaundice in the newborns, assessment of the total serum bilirubin level, measuring the level of G6PD enzyme.

The decision to treat with antihelminthic therapy is complex and based on the stage and number of cysts present, their location, and the patient's specific clinical presentation.  Antihelminthic therapy should be given in combination with corticosteroids and anticonvulsants to reduce inflammation surrounding the cysts and lower the risk of seizures. Albendazole is generally preferable over praziquantel due to its lower cost and fewer drug interactions.  Asymptomatic cysts, such as those discovered incidentally on neuroimaging done for another reason, may never lead to symptomatic disease and in many cases do not require therapy. Calcified cysts have already died and involuted. Further antihelminthic therapy will be of no benefit.\nIn ophthalmic disease, surgical removal is necessary for cysts within the eye itself. Cysts outside the globe can be treated with antihelminthic drugs alone.\nIn general, the subcutaneous disease does not need specific therapy. Painful or bothersome cysts can be surgically excised. Treatment recommendations for subcutaneous cysticercosis includes surgery, praziquantel and albendazole.\nNeurocysticercosis treatment 1.

Most cases of cysticercal encephalitis improve with corticosteroid therapy 1.4 Calcified cysts Radiographic evidence of parenchymal calcifications is a significant risk factor for recurrent seizure activity; these lesions are present in about 10 percent of individuals in regions where neurocysticercosis is endemic. Seizures in these patients should be treated with antiepileptic therapy. 2. Extraparenchymal NCC 2.1 Subarachnoid cysts Preferred regimen: Albendazole 15 mg/kg/day PO bid for 28 days AND (Prednisone up to 60 mg/day PO OR Dexamethasone (up to 24 mg/day)) along with the antiparasitic therapy. The dose can often be tapered after a few weeks. However, in cases for which more prolonged steroid therapy is required, methotrexate can be used as a steroid-sparing agent 2.2 Giant cysts Giant cysticerci are usually accompanied by cerebral edema and mass effect, which should be managed with high-dose corticosteroids (with or without mannitol). 2.3 Intraventricular cysts Emergent management with CSF diversion via a ventriculostomy or placement of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt Treatment of residual hydrocephalus may be managed with endoscopic foraminotomy and endoscopic third ventriculostomy; this approach may also allow debulking of cisternal cysticerci 2.4 Ocular cysticercosis Surgical excision is warranted in the setting of intraocular cysts Cysticercal involvement of the extraocular muscles should be managed with albendazole and corticosteroids. 2.5 Spinal cysticercosis Medical therapy with corticosteroids and antiparasitic drugs\nOcular cysticercosis is considered an absolute contraindication to the use of the following medications:\nPraziquantel"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What does an MRI for aortic stenosis involve?", "output": "Cardiac MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of aortic stenosis. Findings on MRI suggestive of/diagnostic of aortic stenosis include: \nThickening of the aortic valve cusps Diminished aortic valve area Stenotic jets (low signal intensity) Poststenotic dilatation of the ascending aorta Myocardial thickening Delayed myocardial enhancement\nCardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can be used in cases where echocardiographic results are inconclusive.  CMR can assist in measuring heart volumes, blood flow and ventricular wall thickness. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) assists in visualizing the heart vasculature. Phase velocity mapping helps in measuring the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Qp:Qs). CMR is a useful tool in the diagnosis and evaluation of a bicuspid aortic valve. Differentiation may be made between an anatomically bicuspid valve, and an anatomically trileaflet valve with fused comissures (\"functionally-bicuspid valve\"). CMR is invaluable in defining anatomic aortic valve area, in quantitating aortic regurgitation, and in the diagnosis of concomitant cardiovascular abnormalities, such as thoracic aortic dilatation/aneurysm and mitral valve abnormalities.\nThe scan times are longer than most other imaging modalities. The MRI environment itself is often uncomfortable for the patient (loud noises, confined area, patients are required to remain motionless for long periods of time). The MRI environment can potentially be dangerous, if specific safety measures are not strigently followed. Patients should be screened for any surgically implanted device that may not be MRI compatiable before entering the MRI department. The MRI environment must be kept free of any ferro magnetic material, which may otherwise be drawn into the magnet with sufficent force to injure, or kill patients, family and or staff in the area. Small metallic objects such as paper clips or hairpins which may not have significant mass to cause serious injury to a person, may be drawn into the magnet, and distort the magnetic field until removed. The removal of these items is very costly, and may result in downtime of several days for the imaging system. In the event that a serious (potentally life threatening) accident occurs in the MRI scan room, an emergency quench of the magnets' cryogens is performed. In such an instance (very rare) the scan room may be suddenly filled with helium gas, there is the potential for suffocation, cryogen burns, ruptured eardrums. An emergency quench of the magnet is very expensive (the magnet may be ruined) and is considered to be a option of last resort. In the event of medical emergencies in the MRI environment, the general rule of thumb, is to remove the patient from the scan room prior to the arrival of emergency support personnel. Safety of patients, family members, and staff are always the first priority in any MRI facility.  For a successful MRI procedure, breath holding is required, which is sometimes difficult to achieve with small kids.

These antibodies tend to delay in-vitro coagulation in phospholipid-dependent laboratory tests such as the partial thromboplastin time.\nThe initial workup of a prolonged PTT is a mixing test whereby the patient's blood is mixed with normal blood and the clotting is re-assessed. If a clotting inhibitor such as a lupus anticoagulant is present, the inhibitor will interact with the normal blood and the clotting time will remain abnormal. However, if the clotting time of the mixed blood corrects towards normal, the diagnosis of an inhibitor such as the lupus anticoagulant is excluded; the diagnosis is a deficient clotting factor that is replenished by the normal blood.\nIf the mixing test indicates an inhibitor, diagnosis of a lupus anticoagulant is then confirmed with phospholipid -sensitive functional clotting testing, such as the dilute Russell's viper venom time, or the Kaolin clotting time.

This delayed reaction is the result of the multiple inflammatory immune responses that occur during reperfusion. Such inflammatory reactions cause increase in ntracranial pressure, a pressure that leads to cell damage and cell death in some cases. Hypothermia has been shown to help reduce intracranial pressure and thus decrease the adverse effects of inflammatory immune responses during reperfusion. Besides that, reperfusion also increases free radical development. Hypothermia has also been shown to decrease the patient's development of deadly free radicals during reperfusion.\nHydrogen sulfide treatment There are several preliminary studies in mice that seem to show that treatment with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could have a protective effect against reperfusion injury. \nCyclosporine In addition to its well-known immunosuppressive capabilities, the one-time administration of cyclosporine  at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been found to deliver a 40 percent reduction in infarct size in a small group proof of concept study of human patients with reperfusion injury published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2008. Cyclosporine works by inhibiting the action of Cyclophilin D which usually helps in opening Mitochondrial membrane transport protein   (MPT Pore). So once cyclophilin D action is inhibited, there is no more MPT pore opening and in turn, saves the mitochondria from getting damaged. The opening of MTP Pore results in major cell destruction by causing the influx of water into mitochondria, impairing its function and ultimately leading to the collapse. The strategy to protect mitochondria is the most important thing associated with the treatment part.\nTRO40303 TRO40303 is a new cardio protective compound that was shown to inhibit the MP T pore and reduce infarct size after ischemia - reperfusion .\nIschemic Conditioning Flow chart- Ischemic Conditioning Mechanism- Role of ischemic conditioning in preventing and minimizing the damage associated with Reperfusion injury.  Stem cell therapy Recent investigations suggest a possible beneficial effect of mesenchymal stem cells  on heart and kidney reperfusion injury \nSuperoxide dismutase Superoxide dismutase is an important antioxidant enzyme that transforms superoxide anions into water and hydrogen peroxide. Recent work has demonstrated important therapeutic effects on pre-clinical models of reperfusion damage following an ischemic stroke  \nMetformin Some studies proved the role of metformin in preventing Ischemia-Reperfusion injury by inhibiting the opening of MPT Pore and Mitochondrial complex inhibition. Although the studies are done in rats only still the correlation can be derived clinically for humans as well.  \nCannabinoids A synthetic analog of cannabis  helps to prevent hepatic ischemia and injury by reducing the inflammation and oxidative stress occurring through CB2 receptors .

Most commonly this causes skin symptoms (usually livedo reticularis), gangrene of the extremities and sometimes renal failure; problems with other organs may arise, depending on the site at which the cholesterol crystals enter the bloodstream.  When the kidneys are involved, the disease is referred to as atheroembolic renal disease (AERD).  The diagnosis usually involves biopsy (removing a tissue sample) from an affected organ.

Ancillary tests may help in the diagnosis. However, the only definitive test for Loeffler endocarditis is cardiac muscle biopsy showing the presence of eosinophilic infiltrates.\nThe definite diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis is based on cardiac muscle biopsy, showing the presence of eosinophilic infiltrates and sometimes fibrosis. Since the disorder may be patchy, multiple tissue samples taken during the procedure improve the chances of uncovering the pathology but in any case negative results do not exclude the diagnosis.\nThe most common symptoms of Loeffler endocarditis include weight loss, fever, cough, a rash (possibly pruritic) and symptoms of congestive heart failure.\nCommon physical examination findings of Loeffler endocarditis include peripheral oedema, elevated jugular venous pressure, tachycardia, murmur of mitral regurgitation, S3 gallop and possibly S4 sound. (physical findings of heart failure)\nPalpable apex beat and mitral regurgitation help to differentiate restrictive cardiomyopathy may be very similar to those of constrictive pericarditis.\nHypereosinophilia (i.e. blood eosinophil counts at or above 1,500 per microliter) or, less commonly, eosinophilia (counts above 500 but below 1,500 per microliter) are found in the vast majority of cases and are valuable clues pointing to this rather than other types of cardiomyopathies. However, elevated blood eosinophil counts may not occur during the early phase of the disorder. Other, less specific laboratory findings implicate a cardiac disorder but not necessarily eosinophilic myocarditis. These include elevations in blood markers for systemic inflammation (e.g. C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and cardiac injury (e.g. c reatine kinase, troponin s); Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis include marked eosinophilia - at least 0.44 x 109/l.\nAn ECG may be helpful in the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis. Findings on an ECG suggestive of/diagnostic of Loeffler endocarditis include ST segment -T wave abnormalities, and sometimes evidences of atrial enlargement.\nAn x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis. Findings on an x-ray suggestive of Loeffler endocarditis include cardiomegaly and presentation of heart failure and pulmonary edema. Nevertheless, these findings are neither specific nor sensitive for the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis.\nEchocardiography may be helpful in the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis. Findings on an echocardiography suggestive of/diagnostic of Loeffler endocarditis include restrictive filling but pretty good left ventricular systolic function. Echocardiography typically gives non-specific and only occasional findings of endocardium thickening, left ventricul ar hypertrophy, left ventricle dilation, and involvement of the mitral and/or tricuspid valve s. Three\u2010dimensional transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography might provide additional information to conventional two\u2010dimensional transthoracic echocardiography alone in patients with Loeffler endocarditis. \nImproved detection is imparted by the use of a multi-modality investigation, including the use of transesophageal echocardiography and contrast agents.\nA standard transthoracic echocardiogram will typically reveal the following features, which are characteristic of the restrictive cardiomyopathies:\nNormal left ventricular systolic function Normal LV cavity dimensions Diastolic dysfunction Majority of cases advanced dysfunction, typically grade III, formerly known as the \"restrictive filling\" profile Early, incidentally detected cases may have lesser degrees of dysfunction Pulsed wave doppler (mitral inflow) and tissue doppler (mitral annuli) demonstrate: An E/A ratio > 2 A deceleration time (DT) < 160 ms A septal e' < 8 cm/s An LVEDP (septal E/e') > 15\nFeatures which are specific to the hypereosinophilic syndrome include:\nLeft ventricular apical obliteration by laminar thrombosis Diffuse and echogenic thrombus Occurs in the absence of regional wall motion abnormalities The key distinction from the far more common apical thrombosis due to e.g. ischemic heart disease and subsequent apical dyskinesis Thickening and increased echogenicity of subendocardial structures Preferential involvement of the left ventricular posterobasal (inferolateral) wall and posterior leaflet of mitral valve Consequent restricted excursion of mitral valve's posterior leaflet Eccentric mitral regurgitation\nAlthough multimodality imaging is recommended in diagnosis and management of Loeffler endocarditis, but CT scan is barely used a an imaging modality. \nMRI and echocardiography were used extensively in diagnosis and management of these cases.\nCardiac MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis.  Gadolinium -based cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the most useful non-invasive procedure for diagnosing eosinophilic myocarditis. Findings on MRI suggestive of/diagnostic of Loeffler endocarditis include at least two of the following abnormalities: An increased signal in T2-weighted images; An increased global myocardial early enhancement ratio between a myocardial and skeletal muscle in enhanced T1 images and One or more focal enhancements distributed in a non-vascular pattern in late enhanced T1-weighted image s. Additionally, and unlike in other forms of myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis may also show enhanced gadolinium uptake in the sub-endocardium.

Left untreated, the average survival is 5 years after the onset of angina, 3 years after the onset of syncope, and 1 year after the onset of congestive heart failure.    Other symptoms include dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.\nAortic stenosis is most often diagnosed when it is asymptomatic and can sometimes be detected during routine examination of the heart and circulatory system. The major signs include pulsus parvus et tardus (a slow-rising, small volume carotid pulse), a lag time between apical and carotid impulses, and a distinct systolic ejection murmur.\nThe electrocardiogram in the patient with moderate to severe aortic stenosis may reveal left ventricular hypertrophy and heart block.\nExercise testing should not be performed in symptomatic patients with AS but can be used to elicit exercise-induced symptoms and abnormal blood pressure responses in asymptomatic patients. \nChest X-ray may be used as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of aortic stenosis. Findings associated with aortic stenosis include left ventricular hypertrophy and calcification of the aortic valve.\nComputed tomography can be helpful as a diagnostic tool in conditions where the echocardiographic findings are inconclusive.\nMagnetic resonance imaging is rarely used in the diagnosis of aortic stenosis, except in rare cases where the echocardiographic findings are inconclusive. There is a signal void where the high velocity jet exits the aortic valve.\nEchocardiography is the best non-invasive test to evaluate the aortic valve anatomy and function. It is indicated in the case of presence of symptoms suggestive of valvular problems or in the case of detection of a systolic murmur with a grade greater than 3/6. Doppler echocardiography allows the measurement of the maximum jet velocity and can be used to estimate the effective orifice area of the aortic valve as well as the gradient across the aortic valve using the modified Bernoulli equation (gradient = 4 x velocity 2). The flow must be constant, so as the velocity increases, the valve area decreases proportionally. Attention to technical details is important as they may lead to underestimation of the severity of the aortic stenosis.  Echocardiography can also be used to assess the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy.\nLeft and right heart catheterization as well as angiography may be useful in the assessment of the patient prior to aortic valve replacement surgery. In addition, asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis should undergo cardiac catherization when echocardiographic findings are inconsistent with the clinical findings .\nThe aortic valve area is the size of the orifice for blood to flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. The aortic valve area is reduced in aortic stenosis, and the aortic valve area is the metric that is used to gauge the need for aortic valve replacement surgery. The pressure gradient across a narrowed aortic valve cannot be used to gauge the need for valve replacement as the gradient may be low in patients with impaired left ventricular function.\nThe calculation of the aortic valve area is an indirect method used to determine the area of the aortic valve. The calculated aortic valve orifice area is currently one of the measures for evaluating the severity of aortic stenosis. An aortic valve having an area less than 0.8 cm\u00b2 is considered to be severe aortic stenosis.  \nThere are many ways to calculate the aortic valve area. The most commonly used methods involve measurements taken during echocardiography. For interpretation of these values, the aortic valve area is generally divided by the body surface area."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the historical context surrounding acute promyelocytic leukemia?", "output": "In 1882, A.C. Doyle reported on the efficacy of arsenic in acute promyelocytic leukemia.  In 1957, Leif Hillestad described acute promyelocytic leukemia as a distinct clinical condition for the first time. He noted the syndrome of low fibrinogen levels, fibrin degradation, and life-threatening hemorrhage.  It was noted that this condition carried a high mortality rate due to severe hemorrhage.  In 1970, scientists in Harbin showed that arsenic trioxide and mercury chloride could treat acute and chronic leukemia.  In 1973, Bernard and colleagues showed in clinical studies that therapeutic efficacy of daunorubicin, an chemotherapy agent of the anthracycline class. This medication was shown to induce remission in the majority of patients, with an increase in remission rate from 13% to 58%. The median duration of remission with daunorubicin was more than 2 years. Compared to 6-mercaptopurine, daunorubicin was shown to reduce mortality from bleeding after 5 days.  In the early 1990s, it was noted that arsenic trioxide could induce remission in a high proportion of patients.   In 1980, Breitman and colleagues showed that all- trans retinoic acid could lead to the differentiation of the HL-60 cell line of myeloid leukemia. This was the first demonstration that differentiation therapy could treat leukemia. This concept was based on the fact that most cancers are primitive and stem-like, which leads to aggressive and chemo -resistant cellular behavior. Blockade of stemness and induction of differentiation could lead to anti-cancer effect.   In 1988, Huang and colleagues showed that all- trans retinoic acid could successfully treat acute promyelocytic leukemia in 24 patients. The complete remission rate was more tan 90%.  In 1995, D. Head and colleagues showed that higher remission rates and higher survival rates could be achieved with higher doses of daunorubicin, with a survival rate of 61% after 9 years and a 0% relapse after 36 months.  In 1997, scientists in Harbin and Shanghai showed that single-agent arsenic trioxide could induce response rates of 90% in patients who relapsed after receiving all- trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy.  In 2000, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved arsenic trioxide for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.  In 2001, Soignet and colleagues showed that a single, 5-week course of arsenic trioxide carried a complete remission rate of 50%. It was shown that 2 cycles of arsenic trioxide could induce remission in 86% of patients.  In 2013, LoCoco and colleagues showed that, in a randomized phase 3 multi-center clinical trial, a non- chemotherapy -based regimen was superior to a chemotherapy-based regimen for low-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia. Specifically, the combination of all-''trans'' retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide resulted in improved overall survival compared to the combination of all- trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy. This landmark clinical trial, which was conducted by the Italian and German-Austrian Leukemia Study Groups, altered the treatment paradigm for low-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Can you provide a summary of LQT1?", "output": "LQT1 is the most common subtype of long QT syndrome making up to 55% of all cases of long QT syndrome.

In response to low plasma sodium concentration or decreased renal perfusion pressure, the juxtaglomerular apparatus secretes renin. On secretion, renin cleaves angiotensinogen (produced by liver) to angiotensin I. Angiotensin-converting enzyme produced in the lungs further cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The main site of activity for angiotensin II is zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex, where angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone synthase which converts deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone.\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis is a tightly controlled feedback mechanism which regulates sodium and blood pressure in our body.  Low plasma sodium, decreased perfusion pressure and hyperkalemia stimulates aldosterone secretion. Hypokalemia suppresses aldosterone secretion.\nAldosterone is synthesized at a rate of approximately 100 to 150 ug/day.\n\n\nHypoaldosteronism is defined as decreased levels of the hormone aldosterone or a resistance of the target tissue to the actions of aldosterone. Hypoaldosteronism can be due to:  Aldosterone deficiency: The deficiency in aldosterone can be due to congenital isolated hypoaldosteronism, primary adrenal insufficiency, diabetic nephropathy, critical illness, and drugs such as ACE inhibitors, NSAID and calcineurin inhibitors. Aldosterone resistance: In aldosterone resistance, the level of aldosterone is normal but there is decreased response of the target tissue to the actions of aldosterone. Aldosterone resistance is seen with mineralocorticoid receptor defects (seen in pseudohypoaldosteronism) and with drugs such as potassium-sparing diuretics and trimethoprim.\nHypoaldosteronism results in reduced reabsorption of sodium in the principal cells of cortical collecting tubules (CCT). This leads to decreased excretion of potassium and mild non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.\nHyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is most commonly seen in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy:    In patients of renal insufficiency, atrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) leads to decreased sensing of plasma sodium concentration and renal perfusion pressure. With progression of the renal disease and atrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) there may be inadequate renin production and release. A decrease in renin production and release leads to decreased angiotensin production, which eventually causes hypoaldosteronism. Renal insufficiency may also cause decreased response of the principal cells in the cortical collecting tubule to aldosterone.\nHyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism also known as secondary isolated hypoaldosteronism is seen in patients with severe illness such as sepsis, malignancy, heart failure, adrenal dysfunction and liver cirrhosis.    During these stress inducing conditions, increased levels of ACTH and cortisol are seen. Under normal conditions, continuous ACTH secretion for greater than 96 hours leads to suppression of aldosterone synthase activity. Chronically ill patients with prolonged ACTH secretion (>96 hours) have impaired aldosterone synthase activity and decreased levels of aldosterone. In response, the kidneys via its neurohormonal regulation leads to increased levels of renin and hence the term hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism. In addition, cytokine release from chronic illness or increased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (in patients with heart failure) also have an inhibitory effect on the zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex. Hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism is also seen in patients with adrenal dysfunction such as Addison's disease. Primary adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease can be due to adrenal dysgenesis, impaired steroidogenesis, and adrenal destruction. In patients of primary adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands does not produce sufficient cortisol and aldosterone. The decrease in level of aldosterone leads to decreased absorption of sodium in the kidneys and increased retention of potassium. This in turn activates the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) of the kidneys, which secretes renin in an attempt to normalise plasma sodium concentration and perfusion pressure. However, due to adrenal dysfunction the zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex is unable to produce aldosterone and presents with hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism.\nIn isolated hypoaldosteronism, there is selective deficiency of aldosterone with normal cortisol production. Isolated hypoaldosteronism may result from dysfunction of zona glomerulosa or aldosterone synthase deficiency.  Aldosterone synthase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of aldosterone. Patients with aldosterone synthase enzyme deficiency (type I and type II) results in defective conversion of deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone and subsequently abnormal levels of aldosterone. Certain drugs such as heparin and nitric oxide have a direct suppressive effect on the zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex which may lead to decrease production of aldosterone.\nPostadrenalectomy hypoaldosteronism is seen in patients with Conn syndrome who undergo surgery for tumor removal:       \nConn syndrome is most often unilateral and leads to excessive production of aldosterone from the affected adrenal gland. Excessive production of aldosterone causes hypertension and suppression of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). Patients with Conn syndrome who are treated with spironolactone and later undergo surgery for tumor removal may develop hypoaldosteronism. Patients with Conn syndrome have increased levels of aldosterone and decreased plasma renin activity (from suppressed RAAS) which leads to chronic suppression of contralateral zona glomerulosa. On surgical removal of aldosterone producing tumor, there is sudden decline in circulating aldosterone which leads to hypoaldosteronism.\nMineralocorticoid resistance is characterized by a decrease in response to the hormone aldosterone. In mineralocorticoid resistance the level of aldosterone may be normal or supranormal. It is due to this reason mineralocorticoid resistance is also known as pseudohypoaldosteronism. Mineralocorticoid resistance can be further categorized into:   \nPseudohypoaldosteronism Type I: The decrease in response to aldosterone is due to heterozygous or homozygous inactivating mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor. These patients are also resistant to mineralocorticoid therapy. Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type II: This is an extremely rare disorder. It is speculated that these patients have mutations in the genes encoding proteins of the serine threonine kinase family (WKNK1 or WNK4 kinases). Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type II is characterized by low or low-normal plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations, leading to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis with normal renal function. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II is also known as Gordon\u2019s syndrome. Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type III: This condition presents with transient mineralocorticoid resistance. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type III is seen in patients with underlying renal conditions with decreased glomerular filtration rate.

These include, among others, the Braunwald classification system,  the Rizik classification system,  the TIMI risk score,   the GRACE risk score   and the PURSUIT risk score.      In direct comparisons, the GRACE risk score is superior to TIMI risk score in assessing both prognosis and the severity of coronary artery disease in NSTEMI patients.   Regarding predicting the severity of CAD, a cross-sectional study published in 2018 used coronary angiogram to assess the severity of coronary artery disease using the vessel score & Gensini scores and correlated these scores with the GRACE and TIMI scores. The area under the ROC curve for the GRACE score (0.943; 95% CI = 0.893 - 0,993) was significantly superior to the area under the ROC curve for the TIMI score (0.892; 95% CI = 0.853 - 0.937) . Regarding 30 day mortality, a 2016 study correlated 30 day mortality in NSTEMI patients with the NT-proBNP biomarker, TIMI score, and GRACE scores.

Cardiac myxoma was first described in 1845. In 1951, Prichard described a kind of microscopic endocardial structure of the atrial septum, which was suggested to be associated with cardiac myxoma. Clarence Crafoord, a Swedish cardiovascular surgeon successfully removed a cardiac myxoma for the first time in 1954. Before 1951, cardiac myxoma diagnosis was made only at post-mortem examination. In 1959, the first M-mode echocardiogram of a left atrial myxoma was reported. Cardiac myxomas are classified by the WHO histological classification of tumors of the heart \" Benign tumors and tumor-like lesions\" and categorized into a type of pluripotent mesenchymal tumor. Cardiac myxoma arises from remnants of subendocardial vasoformative reserve cells, which are primitive mesenchymal cells that are normally involved in the supportive structure of the endocardium. Myxomas are usually located in the fossa ovalis and endocardium of the atrial septum. Some symptoms of myxoma may be associated with the release of interleukin 6 (IL-6). On gross pathology, a gelatinous, irregular surface that fills the left atrium is the characteristic finding of myxoma. A common histopathological finding is the Gamna-Gandy Bodies that consist of fibrosis and deposition of iron pigments. The main cause of cardiac myxoma remains unknown. However, in some cases like inherited myxomatosis, there is a strong relation with genetic mutations of PRKAR1A gene. Cardiac myxoma should be differentiated from other benign and malignant primary heart tumors including papillary fibroelastoma, lipoma, rhabdomyoma, and cardiac metastasis. Cardiac myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumor in adults, with a reported prevalence of 0.03% in general population. The incidence of cardiac myxoma is about 1/ 100,000 per year. The majority of patients with cardiac myxoma are diagnosed between 30 to 60 years; children are rarely affected. Females are more commonly affected with cardiac myxoma than men. The female-to-male ratio is approximately 1.8 to 1. Cardiac myxomas represent 78% of heart tumors. Common risk factors in the development of myxoma are female gender and genetic predisposition. In some cases, right atrial myxoma has been associated with tricuspid stenosis and atrial fibrillation. If left untreated, cardiac myxoma progression occurs slowly. The overlap of various phenomena such as thrombosis, hemorrhage, or fragmentation may influence tumor growth, detachment, and consequently embolism. Constitutional symptoms, such as: weight loss, fatigue, weakness are often the initial clinical onset of cardiac myxoma, and may resemble those from endocarditis. Metastases are uncommon in cardiac myxoma. Since the majority of the cardiac myxomas are left-sided, it may progress to develop mitral valve obstruction or systemic embolic events, such as stroke. Whereas, right atrial myxomas may obstruct the tricuspid valve and can present as right sided heart failure. Approximately 20% of patients with cardiac myxoma are asymptomatic. Overall, clinical features of cardiac myxoma are associated with the size of the tumor, location, size, and mobility. There is no single diagnostic study of choice for myxoma. Myxoma may be diagnosed based on clinical presentation and detecting the cardiac mass. Symptoms associated with cardiac myxomas are typically due to the effect of the mass of the tumor obstructing the normal blood flow within the heart chambers. Left atrial myxoma symptoms may mimic mitral stenosis, while right atrial myxomas rarely produce symptoms until they have grown to be at least 13 cm wide. General symptoms may also mimic those of infective endocarditis. Cardiac myxoma symptoms may occur at any time, but most often they tend to occur with changes in body position. Common symptoms include: chest pain, palpitation, dizziness, syncope and dyspnea on exertion. There are no specific physical findings for cardiac myxoma. The auscultatory presence of a \"tumor plop\" (which is caused by the obstruction of the mitral valve orifice by the tumor) on physical examination is highly suggestive of cardiac myxoma. Common physical examination findings of cardiac myxoma include systolic or diastolic murmurs (depending on size, mobility, and location of the tumor). Laboratory findings consistent with cardiac myxoma are generally non-specific, results often demonstrate anemia, leukocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. On chest x-ray, cardiac myxoma is characterized by normal results and in some cases a calcification overlying the heart. On CT scan, cardiac myxoma is characterized by low attenuation and areas of dystrophic calcification in cardiac chambers. CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma because it provides better soft-tissue contrast than echocardiography, and it can also differentiate calcification and fat, and may allow tissue diagnosis of some masses such as lipomas. On Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR), cardiac myxoma is characterized by a soft tissue mass within the cardiac chambers isointense to skeletal muscle. This imaging modality plays an important role in the evaluation of cardiac masses and is of great value when echocardiographic findings are suboptimal or when the lesion has an atypical location or appearance. The echocardiogram is the initial modality and most useful diagnostic imaging study in cardiac myxoma. On cardiac ultrasound, cardiac myxoma is characterized by the presence of a heterogeneous pedunculated mass that is commonly located in the left atrium. Echocardiography allows for evaluation assessment of tumor mobility, as it often protrudes through valve flaps. As a testing modality, two-dimensional echocardiography is often coupled with other modalities (such as, Doppler echocardiography) to detect vascular abnormalities that frequently occur in cardiac myxomas. Another diagnostic study for cardiac myxoma is cardiac angiography, which often demonstrates contrast media-enhanced tumor vasculature. There is no known medical therapy for cardiac myxomas. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for cardiac myxoma. The feasibility of surgery depends on the patient hemodynamic stability at diagnosis. Cardiac myxoma surgery has operative mortality around 0 to 3%, depending on risk factors or mechanical damage to a heart valve, as well as adhesion of the tumor to valve leaflets. The short and long-term prognosis is generally regarded as excellent."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Can you explain what a template for a patient information page is?", "output": "In this section you should outline the treatment options, including medications, lifestyle changes, and surgical interventions.\nAdvise the patient to always follow the treatment plan that their doctor has provided them.\nFor an example of a treatment section of a patient information page, click here."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the recommended medical treatment for vertebrobasilar insufficiency?", "output": "In the recent decades, interventional therapy became more and more important with the medical therapy as the foundation of the whole treatment.Open surgery is rarely used because its high risk of complication comparing with the catheter-based therapy."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the underlying medical condition and mechanism that causes angiomyolipoma?", "output": "Genes involved in the pathogenesis of angiomyolipoma include:  \n\nTSC1 gene\nTSC2 gene"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the infection history and symptoms of whipworm?", "output": "Patients with whipworm infection may present with the following history:\nRecent travel to or currently living in an area of known infestation Living in close proximity to water sources Poor personal hygiene Low socioeconomic status"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the name of the surgery used to treat Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome?", "output": "There are no specific contraindications advised as such from a surgical approach point of view.

About 100,000 recent changes in our genome have occurred after the split from the Denisovans.... DNA from fossils unearthed in Denisova Cave in southern Siberia in 2008 revealed a lineage unlike us and closely related to Neanderthals. The precise age of the Denisovan material remains uncertain \u2014 anywhere from 30,000 to 80,000 years of age.... The Denisovans lived in a vast range from Siberia to Southeast Asia. The Denisovans share more genes with people from Papua New Guinea than any other modern population studied.\" \n\"The picture of her genome the girl from Denisova Cave is as accurate as that of modern day human genomes, and shows she had brown eyes, hair and skin.\" \n\"The Denisovans have mysterious origins. They appear to have left little behind for palaeontologists save a tiny finger bone and a wisdom tooth found in Siberia's Denisova cave in 2010.\" \n\"This is an extinct genome sequence of unprecedented accuracy.\" \n\"For most of the genome we can even determine the differences between the two sets of chromosomes that the Denisovan girl inherited from her mother and father.\" \nAbout \"3% of the genes of people living today in Papua New Guinea come from Denisovans, with a trace of their DNA lingering in the Han and Dai people from mainland China.\" \nA genetic \"contribution from Denisovans is found exclusively in island Southeast Asia and Oceania (6).\" \n\"Assuming 6.5 million years of sequence divergence between humans and chimpanzees, the shortening of the Denisovan branch allows the bone to be tentatively dated to between 74,000 and 82,000 years before present, in general agreement with the archaeological dates (2).\" \nLess \"Denisovan allele-sharing occurred with the Dai than with the Han (although nonsignificantly so, Z = \u20130.9) .... Further analysis shows that if Denisovans contributed any DNA to the Dai, it represents less than 0.1% of their genomes today ....\" \n\"Denisovans share more alleles with the three populations from eastern Asia and South America (Dai, Han, and Karitiana) than with the two European populations (French and Sardinian) (Z = 5.3).\" \nDef. \"the fraction of nucleotide sites that are different between a person\u2019s maternal and paternal genomes\" is called heterozygosity. \n\"The great apes have 24 pairs of chromosomes whereas humans have 23. This difference is caused by a fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes that formed the metacentric human chromosome 2 (25) and resulted in the unique head-to-head joining of the telomeric hexameric repeat GGGGTT. A difference in karyotype would likely have reduced the fertility of any offspring of Denisovans and modern humans. We searched all DNA fragments sequenced from the Denisovan individual and identified 12 fragments containing joined repeats. By contrast, reads from several chimpanzees and bonobos failed to yield any such fragments (8). We conclude that Denisovans and modern humans (and presumably Neandertals) shared the fused chromosome 2.\" \n\"In total, we identified 111,812 single-nucleotide changes (SNCs) and 9499 insertions and deletions where modern humans are fixed for the derived state, whereas the Denisovan individual carried the ancestral, i.e., ape-like, variant (8). This is a relatively small number. We identified 260 human-specific SNCs that cause fixed amino acid substitutions in well-defined human genes, 72 fixed SNCs that affect splice sites, and 35 SNCs that affect key positions in well-defined motifs within regulatory regions.\" \n\"One way to identify changes that may have functional consequences is to focus on sites that are highly conserved among primates and that have changed on the modern human lineage after separation from Denisovan ancestors. We note that, among the 23 most conserved positions affected by amino acid changes (primate conservation score of \u22650.95), eight affect genes that are associated with brain function or nervous system development (NOVA1, SLITRK1, KATNA1, LUZP1, ARHGAP32, ADSL, HTR2B, and CNTNAP2). Four of these are involved in axonal and dendritic growth (SLITRK1 and KATNA1) and synaptic transmission (ARHGAP32 and HTR2B), and two have been implicated in autism (ADSL and CNTNAP2). CNTNAP2 is also associated with susceptibility to language disorders (27) and is particularly noteworthy as it is one of the few genes known to be regulated by FOXP2, a transcription factor involved in language and speech development as well as synaptic plasticity (28). It is thus tempting to speculate that crucial aspects of synaptic transmission may have changed in modern humans.\" \n\"Of the 34 genes with clear associations with human diseases that carry fixed substitutions changing the encoded amino acids in present-day humans, four (HPS5, GGCX, ERCC5, and ZMPSTE24) affect the skin and six (RP1L1, GGCX, FRMD7, ABCA4, VCAN, and CRYBB3) affect the eye. Thus, particular aspects of the physiology of the skin and the eye may have changed recently in human history. Another fixed difference occurs in EVC2, which when mutated causes Ellis\u2013van Creveld syndrome. Among other symptoms, this syndrome includes taurodontism, an enlargement of the dental pulp cavity and fusion of the roots, a trait that is common in teeth of Neandertals and other archaic humans. A Denisovan molar found in the cave has an enlarged pulp cavity but lacks fused roots (2). This suggests that the mutation in EVC2, perhaps in conjunction with mutations in other genes, has caused a change in dental morphology in modern humans.\""}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the explanation for delayed puberty in terms of its pathophysiology?", "output": "Delayed puberty is the result of disturbances in hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.

About 25 various genes, in 3 different group of Kallmann syndrome -related genes, hypothalamus - pituitary - gonadal (HPG) axis related genes, and obesity- related genes play roles in delayed puberty. On gross pathology, lack of testicular enlargement in boys or breast development in girls is the characteristic finding of delayed puberty. Microscopic evaluation of ovaries in a patient with delayed puberty may reveal the presence of normal cuboidal epithelium; the ovary has some dense fibrous tissue, about 0.4 mm thick band, in the cortex.

Pulmonic valve lies anterior and superior to the aortic valve at third intercostal space level. Infundibulum of the right ventricle separates it from tricuspid valve. \nStructure: Three equal sized, semilunar cusps or leaflets make up the pulmonary valve. Based on the corresponding aortic valve, the cusps are named right, left and anterior.   The three cusps are joined by commissures and the cusps are thinner when compared to the aortic valve, due to a low pressure in the right ventricle.  Histologically, the pulmonary valve consists of stratified extracellular matrix compartments. The layers constitute fibrosa, spongiosa and ventricularis.  The diameter of pulmonic valve is demonstrated to be closely related to the body size. For adult men (>17 years age) mean pulmonary valve diameter is 26.2 +/- 2.3 mm and 23.9 +/- 2.2 mm for adult women.  Physiology: The right ventricle delivers the received blood entirely to the pulmonary circulation every beat, maintaining optimum pressure.  Pulmonary valve opens during right ventricular systole allowing the deoxygenated blood to be delivered to the lungs.  During the right ventricular diastole the pulmonary valves close completely to prevent regurgitation (back flow) of the blood into the right ventricle.  The closure of the pulmonic valve contributes to the P2 component of the second heart sound (S2).\nThe pathogenesis of pulmonic regurgitation involves the following mechanisms:  \nThe diastolic pressure difference between main pulmonary artery (MPA and right ventricle (RV) is usually very small and steers the pulmonic regurgitation. The right ventricular stiffness due to right ventricular hypertrophy (such as in Tetralogy of Fallot and fibrosis) increases the ventricular diastolic pressure. Increased ventricular diastolic pressure decreases the gradient causing regurgitation. A slight increase in the intrathoracic pressure (such as among ventilated patients) can accentuate PR considerably.  Along with diastolic pressure difference between right ventricle and pulmonary artery, the degree/ severity/ volume of regurgitant jet is dependent on:   Size/ area of the regurgitant orifice Afterload of the right ventricle / capacitance of pulmonary arteries Right ventricle diastolic compliance Duration of right ventricular diastole Torricelli principle sums up some of the factors influencing regurgitant volume: \nPR volume = regurgitant orifice area \u00b7 constant \u00b7 diastolic time \u00b7 mean diastolic pressure difference between the MPA and RV.(P2\u2212P1)0.5.\nThe most common cause of PR is post repair of TOF to relieve right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction. The valvular lesion is thought to be due to the disruption of pulmonary valve's morphological integrity. In a TOF patient even after the RVOT obstruction relief, the right ventricle (RV) is hypertrophied and pulmonary arteries are usually hypoplastic, both demonstrating low compliance. Among children, tachycardia leads to shorter duration diastoles.\nRegurgitation is avoided despite large regurgitation orifice due to Torricelli principle. Progressively, an increased size and capacitance of central pulmonary ateries and right ventricular dilatation occurs due to increased RV stroke volume. The changes described progress with age accompanied by a longer duration of diastole and decreased heart rate. This progressively leads to an increase in the degree of PR.\nThe development of pulmonic regurgitation due to tophus valvular vegetations has been reported in a case. The patient reported had long-standing cyanotic congenital heart disease and developed hyperuricemia secondary to polycythemia. The possible mechanism of development of the vegetations involved hemodynamic valvular trauma in the setting of sustained hyperuricemia and subsequent dystrophic calcification at primary tophus lesion.\nThe exact pathogenesis of dilatation of the pulmonary artery is not fully understood. The demonstration of the disease among pediatric population signals the congenital nature of the etiology. Main pulmonary artery and the origin of its right and left main pulmonary arteries are majorly affected. It is thought that pulmonary artery dilatation is mediated by the unequal division of truncus arteriosus communis. Other proposed mechanisms include maldevelopment of the whole pulmonary tree and the association of hypoplastic aorta with dilated.\nA study utilized pulsed doppler echocardiography and cineangiography to identify the significance of pulmonic valve ring dimensions in the development of PR. It reported the ratio of sagittal to the transverse diameter of the pulmonic valve ring to be greater among patients with PR. In patients with PAH the study also demonstrated greater dilatation of the sagittal diameter of the pulmonic valve ring than pulmonary sinus diameter. In the light of the results, the etiology of PR was attributed to the distortion of pulmonic valve ring.\nAbsent pulmonary valve syndrome (APVS) is rare and involves developmental abnormality and dysplasia or absolute absence of pulmonary valve cusps. A variable degree of dilatation/ aneurysm of the main pulmonary artery always accompanies the disorder. It is thought that the development of pulmonary artery aneurysm is mediated by either the congenital weakness or cystic medial degeneration of the pulmonary artery walls. An association between cystic medial degeneration and increased hemodynamic forces then leads to aneurysm formation. Pulmonary artery aneurysms have been associated with structural cardiac and vascular abnormalities, vasculitis, and infection (such as syphilis). The pathogenesis of Fallot type (APVS) involves either agenesis of ductus arteriosus or post pulmonary stenotic dilatation due to increased stroke volume. Quuadricuspid pulmonary valve is rare but may cause PR. Thick valvular leaflets with decreased mobility without complete closure during diastole may lead to the development of PR. \nPatients with pulmonic regurgitation (PR) develop chronic right ventricular overload resulting in right ventricular remodeling and progressive decline in function. The rate of decline in right ventricular systolic function is also affected by associated conditions such as peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis and pulmonary hypertension which accentuates PR. Among patients with increased pulmonary artery pressure from dysfunction of left ventricle or residual pulmonary artery stenosis the severity of PR is increased. Progressive dilation of the right ventricle results in functional tricuspid regurgitation and increases the risk of developing arrhythmias.\nADAMTS19 has been identified as a novel causative gene for autosomal recessive cardiac valve disease. ADAMTS is a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs protein family. All patients demonstrated anomalies of the aortic and/or pulmonary heart valves, such as thickening of valve leaflets, stenosis and insufficiency.   Among patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation (PR), the gene expression pattern of GRK2 and \u03b22- adrenoceptor (molecular markers of cardiac dysfunction) has been reported to be altered. The lymphocyte expression of described adrenoceptors and kinases demonstrates neurohumoral changes in heart failure.  25% cases of absent pulmonary valve syndrome (APVS) are associated with chromosomal anomalies such as Trisomy 21, Trisomy 13, chromosome 6 and 7 deletions.  22q11 micro-deletion has been shown to be associated with 25% cases of APVS. \nIsolated PR is uncommon and is usually demonstrated with other valvular abnormalities or in certain conditions. The most important conditions/ diseases associated with PR include:\nTOF: Surgical repair of pulmonic stenosis associated with TOF may lead to PR. Post TOF repair, PR is a common complication. Marfan syndrome: Dilatation of pulmonary artery root is one of the established diagnostic criteria of Marfan syndrome.  Although other valvular regurgitations are common in Marfan syndrome, pulmonic regurgitation is also possible. Rheumatic heart disease: The disease is uncommon among developed countries but developing countries still share the burden of the disease.   Syphilis: Although a rare cause, pulmonary artery dilatation and PAH may be caused by tertiary syphilis. Given the prognostic implications and available treatments, early detection of PAH.  Being a sexually transmitted disease (STD), it is important to screen the patient for other STDs.\nOn gross pathology vegetative lesions on the pulmonic valve leaflets may be observed among patient s with acquired alteration in the valvular leaflet morphology. \nOn polarized light microscopy of the material taken from the pulmonic valve, negatively birefringent crystals may be observed in acquired alteration in the valvular leaflet morphology."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What does the physical examination entail for aortic stenosis?", "output": "Aortic stenosis is most often diagnosed when it is asymptomatic and can sometimes be detected during routine examination of the heart and circulatory system.

A major portion of the PR interval reflects the slow conduction of an impulse through the AV node, which is controlled by the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, the PR interval varies with the heart rate, being shorter at faster rates when the sympathetic component predominates, and vice versa. The PR interval tends to increase with age  ;\nIn childhood: 0.10 - 0.20 sec In adolescence: 0.12 - 0.16 sec In adulthood: 0.14 - 0.21 sec\nShortens up to a rate of 140 to 150 beats per minute (bpm) through a withdrawal of parasympathetic tone PR may increase with increasing rate in the presence of digoxin or if the conducting system is diseased.

In specific circumstances, selective testing may be appropriate, such as in patients with underlying diseases or risk factors that would increase their risk for surgical complications. Also in specific high risk surgical procedures, these tests should be done. If there is no significant change in the clinical condition of the patient, it may be safe to use test results that were performed within the past four months. These tests include:\n1. Complete blood count (CBC): Anemia maybe presents in asymptomatic patients and it is common following major surgery. Postoperative mortality maybe predicted by the preoperative hemoglobin level . CBC test should be done for:\nPatients 65 years of age or older. Patients who are undergoing major surgery. Young patients who undergoing major surgery with the expectation to result in significant blood loss. Patients with a history that suggests anemia.\n2. Renal function test (RFT): Serum creatinine concentration should be ordered for patients over the age of 50 undergoing intermediate or high risk surgeries, also it should be ordered if hypotension is likely, or when nephrotoxic medications will be used. Mild to moderate renal impairment is usually asymptomatic. Dosage adjustment of some medications may be needed if the patient has renal insufficiency.\n3. Electrolytes: It is not recommended to be done routinely if the patient does not have a history of electrolytes abnormality.\n4. Blood glucose: Diabetes increases the operative risk in patients undergoing vascular surgery or coronary artery bypass grafting  . Routine measurement of blood glucose is not recommended for healthy patients before the surgery, since some studies showed that unexpected abnormal blood glucose results do not often influence perioperative management  .\n5. Liver function tests (LFT): It is not recommended to do this test routinely unless the patient has a history of liver disease .\n6. Hemostasis tests: It is not recommended to do prothrombin time (PT) or Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) blood tests routinely unless the patient has bleeding disorder or an unusual bleeding tendency . Some doctors have suggested to test all patients who undergoing intermediate to high risk surgeries. This avoids the chance that clinicians may forget to ask the patients about their bleeding history. The bleeding time is not useful in assessing the risk of perioperative hemorrhage  .\n7. Urinalysis: It is usually done to detect any urinary tract infection which has the potential to cause wound infection after the surgery , especially with prosthetic surgery. If the test is positive, the patient should be treated with antibiotics and proceed with surgery without delay. Some studies showed that there is no reduction in the risk of postoperative wound infection if the patient treated with antibiotics before the surgery, and so, it is not indicated to test for Urinary tract infection before the surgery for every patient  .\n8. Pregnancy testing: Pregnant women may need specific perioperative management, this includes specific anesthetic teqniques. An elective surgery may be cancelled or postponed in pregnant women. The American society of anesthesiologists recommends that clinicians consider pregnancy testing for all woman of childbearing age . Many institutions require pregnancy testing for all reproductive age women before surgery.\n9. Electrocardiogram (EKG): This should be done to detect any recent myocardial infarction (MI) which known to be associated with increased surgical morbidity and mortality , also it may be important as a baseline to be compared with the one postoperatively. In general, EKG alone may be a poor indicator of postoperative cardiac complications. The 2007 American college of cardiology/American heart association (ACC/AHA) Guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation states that ECG is not useful in asymptomatic patients undergoing low risk procedures . Also, the European Society of Cardiology 2009 preoperative guidelines do not recommend ECG in patients without risk factors . According to the 2007 ACC/AHA guidelines the 12-lead ECG are recommended for the following patients:\nPatients who are scheduled to undergo vascular surgery and have at least one of the following clinical risk factors:\nIschemic heart disease. Compensated or prior heart failure. Cerebrovascular disease. Diabetes. Renal insufficiency. It is less strongly recommended to perform an ECG for patients scheduled to undergo vascular surgery with no clinical risk factors.\nPatients who are scheduled to undergo intermediate-risk surgery with known cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, or cerebrovascular disease.It is less strongly recommended to perform an ECG for patients scheduled to undergo intermediate-risk surgery with at least one clinical risk factor.\n10. Chest radiograph (Chest x-ray): Its not recommended to do this test routinely before the operations in healthy patients, many studies showed that an abnormal chest x-ray findings may occur frequently, especially in elderly persons . According to the American College of Physicians (ACP), if there is a suspicion of cardiopulmonary disease from the patient's history or physical examination, then this test should be done, also in those older than 50 years of age who are undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery or upper abdominal/thoracic surgery . The American heart association (AHA) recommends preoperative chest x-ray for patients with morbid obesity (BMI \u226540 kg/m2) .\n11.

Genes associated with the pathogenesis of oligoastrocytoma and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma include IDH1, p53, EGFR, ATRX, EGFR, PTEN, MGMT, CIC, and FUBP1. 30-70% of oligoastrocytomas show loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 1p and 19q. On gross pathology, oligoastrocytoma is characterized by a soft, well-defined, grey-tan, mucoid or hemorrhagic, calcified mass with or without necrosis, which may expand the gyrus and cause blurring of the grey-white junction. On microscopic histopathological analysis, oligoastrocytoma is characterized by highly cellular lesions composed of both oligodendroglial and astrocytic components. In addition to the histological features of oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma also has significant or brisk mitotic activity, marked cytologic and nuclear atypia, necrosis, apoptosis, and microvacular proliferation. Oligoastrocytoma is demonstrated by positivity to tumor markers such as MAP2, GFAP, IDH1, OLIG-1 protein, OLIG-2 protein, and Iba-2 protein."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the importance of utilizing cell carcinoma cystoscopy and bladder biopsy in the detection of transitional cell carcinoma?", "output": "Cystoscopy may be helpful in the diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What factors increase the risk of folate deficiency?", "output": "Several factors may put a person at risk for developing Folate deficiency.These include the presence of congenital defect, malabsorptive disorder and alcohol abuse.

It presents with watery discharge, hyperemia, chemosis, and lymphadenopathy. If left untreated, most cases of viral conjunctivitis are mild and will clear in 7 to 14 days without any long-term consequences. if complications arise, viral conjunctivitis can take two or more weeks to resolve. Some cases of viral conjunctivitis may develop stromal or subepithelial abnormalities. In such cases, if subepithelial infiltrates are in the pupillary axis, they may lead to decreased vision. Usually stromal abnormalities may persist for months to years, long after the epithelial changes have resolved.   \nAcute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is often caused by picornavirus. It presents with a severe red, swollen eyes as well as subconjuntival hemorrhaging, and will clear up in 5 to 7 days. If left untreated, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis almost always resolves without sequelae. \nBacterial conjunctivitis presents with red eye, mucopurulent discharge, and chemosis. The incubation period for bacterial conjunctivitis is estimated to be 1 to 7 days. If left untreated, most cases of bacterial conjunctivitis will clear in 7 to 10 days without any long-term consequences. If left untreated, In patients who have purulent or mucopurulent discharge (suspected chlamydial and gonococcal conjunctivitis), who wear contact lenses, and who are immunocompromised, conjunctivitis may cause corneal damage (such as corneal ulcer, scar, and perforation), sepsis, and meningitis. This may lead to permanent blindness and death.   \nHyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis (HBC) is often caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae in sexually active adults. It presents with a severe copious purulent discharge, eyelid swelling, eye pain on palpation, preauricular adenopathy, and decreased vision. If left untreated, hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis may cause corneal involvement, and ultimately corneal perforation. \nNeonatal conjunctivitis is one of the most common infections occurring in the first month of life. Chemical conjunctivitis secondary to silver nitrate solution application usually occurs in the first day of life, and disappears spontaneously within 2- 4 days. In the absence of adequate prophylaxis, 30% to 42% of infants born by vaginal delivery to infected mothers will develop gonococcal conjunctivitis. Gonococcal conjunctivitis tends to occur 2-7 days after birth, and tends to be more severe than other causes of ophthalmia neonatorum. It presents with severe bilateral purulent conjunctivitis, tearing, and eyelids swelling. If left untreated, gonococcal conjunctivitis may cause corneal involvement such as corneal ulceration, diffuse opacification, and corneal perforation. This may lead to blindness, sepsis, or death. The onset of chlamydial conjunctivitis is usually later than gonococcal conjunctivitis. In the absence of adequate prophylaxis, 30%-50% of infants born by vaginal delivery to infected mothers will develop chlamydial conjunctivitis. The incubation period is 5-14 days. Chlamydial conjunctivitis presents with mild hyperemia, watery discharge, eyelid swelling, papillary reaction, and pseudomembrane formation. If left untreated, chlamydial conjunctivitis can progress to copious and purulent discharge. This may lead to central corneal opacification and blindness. Herpetic conjunctivitis is a rare cause of neonatal conjunctivitis. Herpetic conjunctivitis usually occurs within the first 2 weeks after birth and has an incubation period of approximately 6-14 days. If left untreated, HSV conjunctivitis can cause corneal scarring and ulceration. Additionally, disseminated HSV infection can cause central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Ophthalmia neonatorum caused by pseudomonas is rare but can present with eyelid edema, erythema, and purulent discharge. If left untreated, ophthalmia neonatorum can progress to corneal perforation, endophthalmitis, blindness, and possibly death.   \nAllergic conjunctivitis usually presents with itching of the eyes and eyelid swelling. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of the condition, and symptoms are related to season-specific aeroallergens. If left untreated, most cases of allergic conjunctivitis improve by eliminating or significantly reducing contact with the allergen (pollen or animal dander) without any long-term consequences.   \nKeratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) presents with a foreign body sensation, mucoid discharge, ocular dryness, excessive tearing (reflex secretion), photophobia, itching, and blurry vision. Symptoms tend to be worse toward the end of the day with prolonged use of the eyes. If left untreated, it can progress to corneal ulceration, corneal perforation, and ultimately permanent blindness.   \nSuperior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) symptoms develop around the sixth decade of life, and include a foreign body sensation, burning sensation, pruritus, and dry eye sensation. Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is typically associated with remission as the natural history and eventual total resolution, although symptoms may last for years."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you provide me with what you have written for me to rephrase it, please?", "output": "Proton pump inhibitors act by irreversibly blocking the hydrogen / potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the H + /K + ATPase, or more commonly just gastric proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. The proton pump is the terminal stage in gastric acid secretion, being directly responsible for secreting H + ions into the gastric lumen, making it an ideal target for inhibiting acid secretion.\nTargeting the terminal-step in acid production, as well as the irreversible nature of the inhibition, result in a class of drugs that are significantly more effective than H 2 antagonists and reduce gastric acid secretion by up to 99%.\nThe lack of the acid in the stomach will aid in the healing of duodenal ulcers, and reduces the pain from indigestion and heartburn, which can be exacerbated by stomach acid. However, lack of stomach acid may also contribute to hypochlorhydria, a lack of sufficient hydrochloric acid, or HCl. Hydrochloric acid is required for absorption of nutrients, particularly calcium.\nThe proton pump inhibitors are given in an inactive form. The inactive form is neutrally charged (lipophilic) and readily crosses cell membranes into intracellular compartments (like the parietal cell canaliculus) that have acidic environments. In an acid environment, the inactive drug is protonated and rearranges into its active form. As described above, the active form will covalently and irreversibly bind to the gastric proton pump, deactivating it."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What could be the cause of aortic regurgitation in a young person?", "output": "Vasodilators are indicated in patients who have moderate to severe aortic insufficiency, are symptomatic or in those who have concurrent hypertension. ACE inhibitors with captopril in particular may be beneficial in children with partial improvement in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes, mass index determined by 2D- echocardiography and wall stresses also decreased significantly with therapy. A study on benefits of ACE inhibitor in 20 children with aortic insufficiency showed that there was approximately 28% reduction in regurgitant fraction at the end of 1 year of treatment. \nSurgery is indicated in young patients with aortic insufficiency who are:\nSymptomatic or Having left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 50%) or Increased left ventricular end-diastolic/systolic dimension (body size should be taken into account).\nThese indications are similar to those in adults. The choice between aortic valve replacement vs aortic valve repair depends on the cause of aortic insufficiency.\nAortic valve repair is effective in patients who developed aortic insufficiency after undergoing balloon valvuloplasty for aortic stenosis and in those who have prolapsed cusps in VSD. In a study on 21 patients aged between 9 months to 15years who underwent valve repair for aortic insufficiency secondary to balloon dilatation for aortic stenosis showed 100% freedom from re-operation for late failure, and 80% overall freedom from re-intervention at 3 years with significant reduction in regurgitant fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and proximal regurgitant jet/aortic annulus diameter ratio.  Freedom from re-operation was 95%, 87%, and 84% at 1, 5, and 7 years, respectively in patients undergoing valve repair for cusp prolapse. \nAortic valve replacement is another treatment option where mechanical or bioprosthetic valves can be used. Though use of bioprosthetic valves reduces the need for long term systemic anticoagulation, they have a high failure rate of 20% in children due to valve degeneration and calcification.   Mechanical valves with prolonged anticoagulation are preferred as they showed better outcome in yound patients with normalization of end-diastolic volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, and peak systolic strain of the left ventricular myocardium. \nRoss procedure is another alternative surgical procedure where the pulmonary valve is transplanted to the aortic position, and a homograft conduit is implanted from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. Though this procedure shows promising results for aortic valve abnormalities in some,    the use of this technique has been limited by high rates of pulmonary autograft failure with deterioration of right heart homografts.  These rates are higher in children as compared to adults. Further studies aimed at clarifying longer-term outcomes as well as preventing pulmonary homograft deteroration are needed. {{#ev:youtube|r50kKpKefP8}}\nTo summarize, mechanical valve replacement is the preferred surgical option at present in young patients as opposed to valve repair or biological valve replacement in view of lack of evidence of long-term durability and outcomes.

It stimulates dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors and blocks alpha- adrenoreceptors.  Current studies imply that the major effect of hydergine may be the modulation of synaptic neurotransmission rather than solely increasing blood flow as was once thought.  A prominent feature that accompanies aging is an increase in monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels.  This results in decreased availability of catecholamines in the synaptic cleft. In one study, an interaction between age and hydergine treatment was observed in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum.

In 2005, breast cancer caused 502,000 deaths (7% of cancer deaths; almost 1% of all deaths) worldwide.  Among women worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cause of death due to cancer. \nIn the United States, breast cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death (after lung cancer and colon cancer). In 2007, breast cancer caused approximately 40,910 deaths (7% of cancer deaths; almost 2% of all deaths) in the U.S.  Among women in the U.S., breast cancer is the most common form of cancer and the second- most common cause of cancer death (after lung cancer).  Women in the U.S. have a 1 in 8 lifetime chance of developing invasive breast cancer and a 1 in 33 chance of breast cancer causing their death.  A U.S. study conducted in 2005 by the Society for Women's Health Research indicated that breast cancer remains the most feared disease,  even though heart disease is a much more common cause of death amongst women. \nThe number of cases has significantly increased since the 1970s, a phenomenon partly blamed on modern lifestyles in the Western world.   Because the breast is composed of identical tissues in males and females, breast cancer also occurs in males, although it is less common. \nEpidemiological risk factors for a disease can provide important clues regarding the etiology of a disease. The first work on breast cancer epidemiology was done by Janet Lane-Claypon, who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control patients of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health.\nToday, breast cancer, like other forms of cancer, is considered to be the final outcome of multiple environmental and hereditary factors. Some of the effects of environmental and hereditary factors that ultimately cause breast cancer are:\nAlthough many epidemiological risk factors have been identified, the specific cause of any individual breast cancer is often unknown. In other words, epidemiological research is able to provide information regarding the patterns of breast cancer incidence across certain populations, but not in a given individual. Approximately 5% of new breast cancers are attributable to hereditary syndromes, while no etiology is known for the other 95% of cases. \nThe primary risk factors that have been identified are: sex,  age,  childbearing, hormones,  a high-fat diet,  alcohol intake,  obesity,  and environmental factors such as tobacco use and radiation."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the physical examination procedure for diagnosing bronchiolitis in adult patients?", "output": "Patients with adult bronchiolitis usually appear lethargic.

In Michigan, for decades authorities used copper sulphate as a molluscicide to reduce snail host populations and thereby the incidence of swimmer's itch. The results with this agent have been inconclusive, possibly because\nSnails become tolerant Local water chemistry reduces the molluscicide's efficacy Local currents diffuse it Adjacent snail populations repopulate a treated area. \nMore importantly, perhaps, copper sulphate is toxic to more than just molluscs, and the effects of its use on aquatic ecosystems are not well understood. Another method targeting the snail host, mechanical disturbance of snail habitat, has been also tried in some areas of North America  and Lake Annecy in France, with promising results. Some work in Michigan suggests that administering praziquantel to hatchling waterfowl can reduce local swimmer's itch rates in humans.

UDP-Galactose can undergo isomerisation in a reversible manner into UDP-glucose by the enzyme epimerase.\nAbnormalities in any of the enzymes involved in each of the steps of the Leloir pathway can give rise to the pathological condition called galactosemia.\nDeficiency or reduced activity of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase enzyme leads to accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate  which: Sequesters phosphate essential for energy production in the human body  Inhibits enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, such as pyrophosphorylase  Inhibits galactosyl trasnferase thereby leading to defects in glycosylation  Galactokinase deficiency results in accumulation of galactose which gets converted to galactitol by a minor pathway.  This molecule predisposes to cataract by causing: Swelling of the lens Denaturation of the proteins Rupture of cell membranes  Epimerase deficiency results in increased UDP-galactose and suppressed UDP-glucose with the ratio changing with the galactose concentration. This can have affects on the glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis.

It is performed by measuring the arterial blood gases of the patient while he breathes room air, then re-measuring the blood gases after the patient has breathed 100% oxygen for 10 minutes.   If the cause of the cyanosis is due to poor oxygen saturation by the lungs, allowing the patient to breath 100% O2 will augment the lungs' ability to saturate the blood with oxygen, and the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood will rise (usually above 150 mmHg ). However, if the lungs are healthy and already fully saturating the blood that is delivered to them, then supplemental oxygen will have no effect, and the partial pressure of oxygen will usually remain below 100mmHg.  In this case, the cyanosis is most likely due to blood that moves from the systemic veins to the systemic arteries via a right-to-left shunt without ever going through the lungs."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the upcoming or experimental treatments for schizophrenia?", "output": "An approach broadly known as the anti-psychiatry movement, most active in the 1960s, opposes the orthodox medical view of schizophrenia as an illness.  Psychiatrist Thomas Szasz argued that psychiatric patients are not ill rather individuals with unconventional thoughts and behavior that make society uncomfortable.  He argues that society unjustly seeks to control them by classifying their behavior as an illness and forcibly treating them as a method of social control. According to this view, \"schizophrenia\" does not actually exist but is merely a form of social construction, created by society's concept of what constitutes normality and abnormality. Szasz has never considered himself to be \"anti-psychiatry\" in the sense of being against psychiatric treatment, but simply believes that treatment should be conducted between consenting adults, rather than imposed upon anyone against his or her will. Similarly, psychiatrists R. D. Laing, Silvano Arieti, Theodore Lidz and Colin Ross  have argued that the symptoms of what is called mental illness are comprehensible reactions to impossible demands that society and particularly family life places on some sensitive individuals. Laing, Arieti, Lidz and Ross were notable in valuing the content of psychotic experience as worthy of interpretation, rather than considering it simply as a secondary but essentially meaningless marker of underlying psychological or neurological distress. Laing described eleven case studies of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and argued that the content of their actions and statements was meaningful and logical in the context of their family and life situations.  In the books Schizophrenia and the Family and The Origin and Treatment of Schizophrenic Disorders Lidz and his colleagues explain their belief that parental behaviour can result in mental illness in children. Arieti's Interpretation of Schizophrenia won the 1975 scientific National Book Award in the United States.\nThe concept of schizophrenia as a result of civilization has been developed further by psychologist Julian Jaynes in his 1976 book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind; he proposed that until the beginning of historic times, schizophrenia or a similar condition was the normal state of human consciousness.  This would take the form of a \" bicameral mind \" where a normal state of low affect, suitable for routine activities, would be interrupted in moments of crisis by \"mysterious voices\" giving instructions, which early people characterized as interventions from the gods. Researchers into shamanism have speculated that in some cultures schizophrenia or related conditions may predispose an individual to becoming a shaman;  the experience of having access to multiple realities is not uncommon in schizophrenia, and is a core experience in many shamanic traditions. Equally, the shaman may have the skill to bring on and direct some of the altered states of consciousness psychiatrists label as illness. Psychohistorians, on the other hand, accept the psychiatric diagnoses. However, unlike the current medical model of mental disorders they argue that poor parenting in tribal societies causes the shaman's schizoid personalities.  Speculation regarding primary and important religious figures as having schizophrenia abound. Commentators such as Paul Kurtz and others have endorsed the idea that major religious figures experienced psychosis, heard voices and displayed delusions of grandeur. \nPsychiatrist Tim Crow has argued that schizophrenia may be the evolutionary price we pay for a left brain hemisphere specialization for language.  Since psychosis is associated with greater levels of right brain hemisphere activation and a reduction in the usual left brain hemisphere dominance, our language abilities may have evolved at the cost of causing schizophrenia when this system breaks down."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the underlying process of lymphadenopathy?", "output": "On microscopic histopathological analysis, characteristic findings of lymphadenopathy will depend on the etiology.Common findings, include: \nNon-specific reactive follicular hyperplasia (NSRFH)\nLarge spaced cortical follicles Tingible body macrophages, normal dark/light GC pattern\nLymph node metastasis\nForeign cell population (usually in subcapsular sinuses) +/-nuclear atypia +/- malignant architecture\nToxoplasmosis\nLarge follicles Epithelioid cells perifollicular & intrafollicular Reactive GCs Monocytoid cell clusters\nCat-scratch disease\nPMNs in necrotic area \"Stellate\" (or serpentine) shaped micro-abscesses Presence of granulomas\nDermatopathic lymphadenopathy\nMelanin -laden histiocytes Histiocytosis\nSystemic lupus erythematosus lymphadenopathy\nBlue hematoxylin bodies Necrosis No PMNs\nHistology can provide more information regarding the cause of lymphadenopathy when etiology is not clear during initial history taking, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation.\nCommon causes of lymphadenopathy with their associated histological findings include:\nBacterial lymphadenitis: Neutrophil -rich infiltrate can be found within the sinus and medullary cords.

He introduced quarantine as a means of limiting the spread of contagious and infectious diseases in The Canon of Medicine, circa 1020. He also stated that bodily secretion is contaminated by foul foreign earthly bodies before being infected, but he did not view them as primary causes of disease.\nWhen the Black Death bubonic plague reached al-Andalus in the 14th century, Ibn Khatima and Ibn al-Khatib hypothesized that infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms which enter the human body. Such ideas became more popular in Europe during the renaissance, particularly through the writing of the Italian monk Girolamo Fracastoro. \nAnton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) advanced the science of microscopy, allowing for easy visualization of bacteria.\nLouis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases are caused by infectious agents, and developed a vaccine for rabies.\nRobert Koch, provided the study of infectious diseases with a scientific basis known as Koch's postulates.\nEdward Jenner, Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin developed effective vaccines for smallpox and polio, which would later result in the eradication and near-eradication of these diseases, respectively.\nAlexander Fleming discovered the world's first antibiotic Penicillin.\nGerhard Domagk develops Sulphonamides, the first broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs.\n\n\nA pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.\nPlague of Justinian, from 541 to 750, killed between 50 and 60 percent of Europe's population.  The Black Death of 1347 to 1352 killed 25 million in Europe over 5 years (estimated to be between 25 and 50% of the populations of Europe, Asia, and Africa - the world population at the time was 500 million). The introduction of smallpox, measles and typhus to the areas of Central and South America by European explorers during the 15th and 16th centuries caused pandemics among the native inhabitants. Between 1518 and 1568 disease pandemics are said to have caused the population of Mexico to fall from 20 million to 3 million.  The first European influenza epidemic occurred between 1556 and 1560, with an estimated mortality rate of 20%.  Smallpox killed an estimated 60 million Europeans in the 18th century alone. Up to 30% percent of those infected, including 80% of the children under 5 years of age, died from the disease, and one third of the survivors went blind.  The Influenza Pandemic of 1918 (or the Spanish Flu) killed 25-50 million people (about 2% of world population of 1.7 billion).  Today Influenza kills about 250,000 to 500,000 worldwide each year.\n\n\nIn most cases, microorganisms live in harmony with their hosts. Such is the case for many tropical viruses and the insects, monkeys, or other animals in which they have lived and reproduced. Because the microbes and their hosts have co-evolved, the hosts gradually become resistant to the microorganisms. When a microbe jumps from a long-time animal host to a human being, it may cease to be a harmless parasite and become pathogenic.\nWith most new infectious diseases, some human action is involved, changing the environment so that an existing microbe can take up residence in a new niche. When that happens, a pathogen that had been confined to a remote habitat appears in a new or wider region, or a microbe that had infected only animals suddenly begins to cause human disease.\nSeveral human activities have led to the emergence and spread of new diseases, see also Globalization and Disease:\nEncroachment on wildlife habitats. The construction of new villages and housing developments in rural areas brings people into contact with animals--and the microbes they harbor. Changes in agriculture. The introduction of new crops attracts new crop pests and the microbes they carry to farming communities, exposing people to unfamiliar diseases. The destruction of rain forests. As countries make use of their rain forests, by building roads through forests and clearing areas for settlement or commercial ventures, people encounter insects and other animals harboring previously unknown microorganisms. Uncontrolled urbanization. The rapid growth of cities in many developing countries tends to concentrate large numbers of people into crowded areas with poor sanitation. These conditions foster transmission of contagious diseases. Modern transport. Ships and other cargo carriers often harbor unintended \"passengers\", that can spread diseases to faraway destinations. While with international jet-airplane travel, people infected with a disease can carry it to distant lands, or home to their families, before their first symptoms appear.\nThe medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of Infectiology and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of Epidemiology. Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists. For example, an \"uncomplicated\" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners, as well as laboratory scientists, immunologists, bacteriologists and other specialists..\nAn infectious disease team may be alerted when:\nThe disease has not been definitively diagnosed after an initial workup The patient is immunocompromised (for example, in AIDS or after chemotherapy); The infectious agent is of an uncommon nature (e.g. tropical diseases); The disease has not responded to first line antibiotics; The disease might be dangerous to other patients, and the patient might have to be isolated."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What other diagnostic tests can be performed for Budd-Chiari syndrome?", "output": "Liver biopsy and histology is a useful investigation if liver transplantation is being considered as it helps identify the degree of hepatocellular damage and the degree of fibrosis.

These contain hemoglobin which gives blood its red color. The iron -containing heme portion of Hemoglobin facilitates hemoglobin-bound transportation of oxygen and carbon dioxide by selectively binding to these respiratory gasses and greatly increasing their solubility in blood. White blood cells help to resist infections, and platelets are important in the clotting of blood.\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. Blood is pumped from the strong left ventricle of the heart through arteries to peripheral tissues and returns to the right atrium of the heart through veins, blood then enters the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins, blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air in the lungs to all of the cells of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, produced as a waste product of metabolism by cells, to the lungs to be exhaled.\nMedical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato- (BE: haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word \" haima \" for \"blood.\" Anatomically, blood is considered a connective

Right ventricular asynergy as demonstrated by echocardiography or cardiac nuclear imaging. Mean right arterial pressure of \u2265 10 mm Hg or a < 5 mm Hg difference from mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (equivalent to left atrial pressure). Non-compliant right atrial pressure waveform pattern (steep and deep x and y descents)\nClinical triad of hypotension, clear lung fields, and jugular venous distention. Electrocardiogram In addition to evidence of an acute inferior or inferoposterior myocardial infarction, the ECG may demonstrate \u2265 1 mm of doming ST elevation in the right sided precordial leads V4R to V6R. Right sided ST elevation, particularly in V4R, is indicative of acute right ventricular injury    and correlates closely with occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery. In one report of patients with acute inferior infarction, for example, ST elevation in V4R had 88 percent sensitivity and 78 percent specificity for concurrent right ventricular infarction.  Pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, and anteroseptal myocardial infarction also causes elevation of the ST segment in the right-sided precordial leads. As a result, an electrocardiographic diagnosis of right ventricular infarction cannot be made when one of these conditions is present.  \nThe right atrial pressure exceeds 10 mm Hg and the ratio of right atrial pressure to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure exceeds 0.8 (normal mean value less than 0.6).     \nHowever, these findings may not be present in patients with only minimal right ventricular dysfunction or in those with intravascular volume depletion. In the latter setting, a volume challenge may unmask the signs of right ventricular infarction."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is Gonadoblastoma, and how can it be distinguished from other illnesses?", "output": "Gonadoblastoma must be differentiated from other diseases that is associated with virilization, and primary amenorrhea and also must be differentiated pathologically from dysgerminoma, Sex-cord stromal tumors, and Sertoli-cell nodules."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is being added?

Most earaches are caused by either acute otitis externa or by acute otitis media; it is very unusual to see both in the same ear at the same time. Acute otitis media and acute otitis externa are easily confused because both can cause earache and drainage from the ear (otorrhea). In middle ear infections, drainage only occurs if the tympanic membrane has a perforation or severe retraction pocket. When there is chronic suppurative otitis media, with or without cholesteatoma, the drainage in the ear canal may appear identical to drainage from external otitis. The primary distinction between acute otitis media and acute otitis externa is that otitis externa is characterized by swelling of the ear canal skin, and there is increased pain on any pushing or pulling of the ear.\nMonocular otoscopy, the most common means used by family physicians and pediatricians to examine ears, has the severe limitation of providing no depth perception for the examiner. Uncertainty of the exact diagnosis can lead to unnecessarily excessive prescribing to cover treatment for both otitis media and otitis externa. Differentiating external otitis from otitis media is readily accomplished using a binocular microscope, which allows comfortable and safe cleaning of any wax or debris in the ear canal, yielding a complete view of the visble parts of the ear canal and eardrum. Most otolaryngologists have binocular microscopes in their offices and are trained to quickly accomplish this task, increasing the likelihood of a correct, definitive diagnosis, which can then be treated appropriately. Cleaning of an infected ear canal promotes better contact of the topical antibiotic drops and shortens recovery time. Children with surgically inserted ear tubes who fail to keep water out of their ears often develop painless drainage from resulting bacterial otitis media. This is not external otitis, but otitis media. It is painless because the opening maintained by the tube, assuming no obstructing crusts or blood clot, prevents pressure from building up within the middle ear. This problem typically clears with antibiotic drops only and does not require oral antibiotics.\nQuinolone antibiotics in topical form (ear drops) have been shown to be of benefit in stopping discharge from otitis media through an open eardrum, and so some treatments for otitis externa may be of benefit to otitis media.  The main pitfall of having a case of otitis media misdiagnosed as otitis externa is that a serious infection of the middle-ear may have complications and sequel over time. Additionally, many types of topical ear drops that are safe and effective for use in the ear canal can be irritating and even damaging if allowed past the ear drum into the more delicate internal membranes of the middle-ear, prompting the warning that such topical preparations should not be used unless the tympanic membrane is known to be intact. For both reasons, caution is given against self-treatment of earache without proper medical evaluation.\nIf there is prolonged drainage of noxious substances from the middle ear through the ear drum, then the skin of the ear canal may become secondarily inflamed. In this situation, one that occurs only in individuals with severe chronic otitis media, both external otitis and otitis media are present at that same time. Prolonged care by a qualified specialist is generally required."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the meaning of premenstrual syndrome?", "output": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) (also called PMT or Premenstrual Tension) is a collection of physical, psychological, and emotional symptoms related to a woman's menstrual cycle. While most women (about 80 to 95 percent) of child-bearing age have some premenstrual symptoms,  women with PMS have symptoms of \"sufficient severity to interfere with some aspects of life\".  Further, such symptoms are predictable and occur regularly during the two weeks prior to menses. The symptoms may vanish after the bleeding starts, but may continue even after bleeding has begun. Also, many females get easily irritated during PMS.  About 14 percent of women between the ages of 20 to 35 become so affected that they must stay home from school or work. \nFor some women with PMS, the symptoms are so severe that they are considered disabling. This form of PMS has its own psychiatric designation: premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).\nCulturally, the abbreviation PMS is widely understood in the United States to refer to difficulties associated with menses, and the abbreviation is used frequently even in casual and colloquial settings, without regard to medical rigor.

During the procedure, the doctor inserts a speculum to keep the vagina open so that the cervix and vagina can be seen clearly. Then, the doctor scrapes a sample of cells and mucus lightly from the exocervix. Next, the samples will be examined under a microscope in the laboratory. Colposcopy and biopsy: In this procedure, the doctor will use the colposcope to examine the cervix and vagina in order to see the vaginal walls and the surface of the cervix closely and clearly. If an abnormal area is seen on the cervix, a biopsy will be done. Computed tomography (CT) scan: CT scans are often used to diagnose vaginal cancer. It can confirm the location of the cancer and show the organs near the vagina, as well as lymph nodes and distant organs where the cancer might have spread. These are helpful for determining the stage of the cancer and in determining whether surgery is a good treatment option. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI uses magnetic fields but it is a different type of image than what is produced by computed tomography (CT) and produces detailed images of the body. Like computed tomography (CT), a contrast agent may be injected into a patient\u2019s vein to create a better picture.

Chest radiography is widely available, inexpensive, and carries low risk to the patient being examined. Therefore it is often the first test to image the heart and great vessels in patients with suspected cardiovascular disease, although much of the information about the cardiovascular system obtained from a chest x-ray is indirect and non-specific.\nThe test is performed by placing an x-ray film (or digital detector) parallel to the chest wall and then exposing the film to x-rays generated from a source on the opposite side of the patient's body. The standard views most useful for evaluating cardiovascular structures are the postero-anterior (PA) view, in which the film is placed anterior to the chest and x-rays travel through the patient from posterior to anterior before reaching the film, and the antero-posterior (AP) view, in which the film is against the patient's back and the x-ray generator is anterior to the patient's body. The PA view places the heart closer to the x-ray film, resulting in less x-ray scatter and a more accurate representation of the cardiac size, but the AP view is often advantageous because it does not require any active participation from the patient and can be performed with a portable x-ray generator; that is, the film cartridge can be placed in bed behind a patient too unstable to travel to the radiology exam room and stand up in front of the x-ray apparatus.

Epidemiological evidence strongly suggests that this outbreak involved person-to-person transmission of Nipah virus, which had not previously been confirmed. 92% of cases involved close contact with at least one other person infected with Nipah virus. Two cases involved a single short exposure to an ill patient, including a rickshaw driver who transported a patient to hospital. In addition, at least six cases involved acute respiratory distress syndrome which has not been reported previously for Nipah virus illness in humans. This symptom is likely to have assisted human-to-human transmission through large droplet dispersal. 2005 January, Tangail district, Bangladesh: 12 cases with 11 fatalities (92% mortality). The virus was probably contracted from drinking date palm juice contaminated by fruit bat droppings or saliva. 2007 February \u2013 May, Nadia District, India: up to 50 cases with five fatalities.

Both the trainer and a stable hand were involved in nursing the index case and both fell ill within one week of the horse\u2019s death with an influenza-like illness. The stable hand recovered while the trainer died of respiratory and renal failure. The source of virus was most likely frothy nasal discharge from the index case.\nA second outbreak occurred in August 1994 (chronologically preceding the first outbreak) in Mackay 1000km north of Brisbane resulting in the deaths of two horses and their owner. The owner assisted in autopsies of the horses and within three weeks was admitted to hospital suffering from meningitis. He recovered, but 14 months later developed neurologic signs and died. This outbreak was diagnosed retrospectively by the presence of Hendra virus in the brain of the patient.\nA survey of wildlife in the outbreak areas was conducted and identified pteropid fruit bats as the most likely source of Hendra virus with a seroprevalence of 47%. All of the other 46 species sampled were negative. Virus isolations from the reproductive tract and urine of wild bats indicated that transmission to horses may have occurred via exposure to bat urine or birthing fluids.\nFour more incidents, in Cairns in January 1999 and October 2004, in Townsville in December 2004 and on the Sunshine Coast in June 2006 each resulted in the death of one horse. A vet involved in autopsy of the horse from the 2004 Townsville incident developed a Hendra-related illness soon after and recovered.\nThe distribution of black and spectacled flying foxes covers Townsville and Cairns, and the timing of incidents indicates a seasonal pattern of outbreaks possibly related to the seasonality of fruit bat birthing. As there is no evidence of transmission to humans directly from bats, it is thought that human infection only occurs via an intermediate host.\nWhere are Hendra and Nipah viruses found?\nThe natural reservoir for Hendra virus is thought to be flying foxes (bats of the genus Pteropus) found in Australia. The natural reservoir for Nipah virus is still under investigation, but preliminary data suggest that bats of the genus Pteropus are also the reservoirs for Nipah virus in Malaysia.\nWhere are the diseases found?\nHendra virus caused disease in horses in Australia, and the human infections there were due to direct exposure to tissues and secretions from infected horses. Nipah virus caused a relatively mild disease in pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. Nipah virus was transmitted to humans, cats, and dogs through close contact with infected pigs."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What does the physical examination for depression entail in a clinical setting?", "output": "Physical examination of patients with major depressive disorder is usually normal.

The right ventricle is small and the pulmonary artery in some cases is hypoplastic. Atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen oval (PFO) is necessary for passing the blood from the right atrium to the left system and without them the infants will not survive. The majority of infants die without palliative surgery. Tricuspid atresia was first discovered by Friedrich Ludwig kreysig in 1817, a German physician who found the obstruction between the right atrium and right ventricle in the autopsy of cyanotic infants. The classic term of tricuspid atresia was used firstly by schuberg in 1861. Tricuspid atresia occurs during prenatal development. In tricuspid atresia, there is no continuity between the right atrium and right ventricle. Inferior vena cava and superior vena cava collect venous nonoxygenated blood into the right atrium. Through atrial septal defect (ASD), blood come into the left atrium, then left ventricle and aorta.This blood is a mixture of saturated and unsaturated O2. If there is a ventricular septal defect (VSD), this mixed blood in the left ventricle flows into the right ventricle, then via pulmonary artery reaches pulmonary bed and becomes oxygenated, then returns back into the left atrium via pulmonary veins. In diminished pulmonary blood flow whether the flow is dependent on patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the mixed-blood in aorta flows from this passage into pulmonary artery and pulmonary bed. In the presence of normal positioning of great arteries, cyanosis is more prominent and is affected by the size of VSD. Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and subaortic stenosis are other associated anomalies. Some Genes mutation in tricuspid valvopathy includes: missense mutation in RASA1 that regulates Ras/ERK cascade, a missense mutation in NFATC1 that downregulates the Ras/ERK pathway. Familial recurrence of tricuspid atresia is rare. Few cases of an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance are reported.Patients with tricuspid atresia should be differentiated from other cardiac causes of cyanosis and lung olygemia include: Tetralogy of Fallot, Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, Pulmonary atresia, Tricuspid stenosis. Worldwide, the prevalence of tricuspid atresia is 7.8 per 100,000 persons. Tricuspid atresia is a congenital heart disease observed among infants at the time of birth. Tricuspid atresia affects males and females equally. There is no racial predilection for tricuspid atresia. Common risk factors related to tricuspid atresia include: chromosomal abnormality, taking teratogenic medications by mother during pregnancy such as phenytoin, retinoic acid, smoking, alcohol consumption during pregnancy, Mother comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, phenylketonuria, thyroid disease, epilepsy, connective tissue disorders, Infections during pregnancy such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, Coxsackie, herpes virus 6, toxoplasmosis gondi, parvovirus B19, HIV, influenza. Early clinical features in infants include cyanosis of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, tiring easily during feeding. The severity of cyanosis in infants with pulmonary stenosis is dependent on the amount of pulmonary blood flow passing through patent ductus arteriosus. After physiologic closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the cyanosis will be aggravated. In patients with normal pulmonary blood flow, complications of heart failure may occur. Prognosis is generally poor without surgery and 90% of patients will die before 10 years old. Symptoms of tricuspid atresia in neonates may include: central cyanosis in mucous membranes and tongue, poor feeding and growth retardation, difficulty in breathing, rapid heartbeats, rapid breathing.Symptoms of longstanding cyanosis and hyperviscosity syndrome as a result of secondary erythrocytosis in older children include the following: headache, alter mentation, faintness, dizziness, visual disturbances, paresthesia, tinnitus, myalgia. Patients with pulmonary stenosis and closed PAD usually appear cyanotic after birth. Conversely, patients with VSD and high pulmonary blood flow without stenotic pulmonary arteries present with signs of overt heart failure without cyanosis.In cyanotic older patients laboratory findings may include: Polycythemia due to secondary erythrocytosis, elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, decreased levels of factors 5,7,8,9: qualitative and quantitative, platelet disorder, increased fibrinolysis and paradoxical thrombotic tendency, proteinuria, hyperuricemia, renal failure, uric acid nephrolithiasis. An ECG may be helpful in the diagnosis of tricuspid atresia. Findings on an ECG suggestive of tricuspid atresia include: left axis deviation, left ventricle hypertrophy, right atrium enlargement, left atrium enlargement. Findings on an x-ray suggestive of tricuspid atresia include: situs solitus, left-sided aortic arch, levocardia, absent main pulmonary artery, pulmonary oligemia with decreased vascular markings, right aortic arch in %25 of cases. Common advantages of cardiac CT scan include assessment of Fontan circuit with an injection of contrast into superior vena cava and filling of the pulmonary system, assessment of right ventricle and left ventricle morphology and function, assessment of vascular stenting patency. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is commonly used for long term management of Fontan patients. Three-dimensional echocardiography is a modality of choice for assessment of: cardiac output, anatomy of valves, anatomy of the septal structure, chamber sizing and volume, the severity of valvular regurgitation and stenosis. Catheterization may measure the gradient between the left ventricle and left atrium in subaortic stenosis. The mainstay of therapy for the cyanotic neonate with severe pulmonary stenosis and small-sized VSD is using prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) for keeping patency of ductus arteriosis. For patients with heart failure symptoms initiating diuretic for reduction of congestion and then starting ACEI is recommended. Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for tricuspid atresia. In the first 8 weeks of life if there are severe Cyanosis and pulmonary obstruction and normal positioning aorta and pulmonary artery, making a shunt between systemic subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery is necessary which is called Blalock -Taussig (BT shunt). If the pulmonary artery comes from the left ventricle and is overflowed, pulmonary artery banding is useful for lowering the pulmonary blood flow. In older children, bi-direction Glenn shunt which is the connection between superior vena cava to the pulmonary artery is planned for transferring the blood to the pulmonary system. Fontan procedure is a conduit between the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary artery whether transfers the systemic venous blood to pulmonary circulation at the age of 2-3 years old. Effective measures for the primary prevention of tricuspid atresia as prenatal screening include fetal sonography between 10-14 weeks of pregnancy for measurement of nuchal translucency thickness, fetal echocardiography between 18-22 weeks of pregnancy. Secondary prevention strategies following the Fontan procedure include serial checking EKG, Transthoracic echocardiography, Pulse oximetry, Holter monitoring, Cardiac MRI, Exercise test."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you please explain the meaning of hypoplastic right heart syndrome?", "output": "Hypoplastic right heart syndrome is a congenital heart defect in which the right ventricle of the heart fails to grow and develop appropriately.       The underdeveloped ventricle cannot contain the proper amount of blood pumped from the right atrium. The ventricle\u2019s muscle structure is poor, so additional problems are encountered as the heart attempts to pump blood to the pulmonary valve for transfer to the lungs. Hypoplastic right heart syndrome needs immediate and emergency treatment, as the heart begins to fail almost immediately after birth. An inadequate blood supply to the lungs means a poor return of oxygenated blood to the body, and the muscle in the ventricle will exhaust easily."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you please provide me the current wording of the sentence you want me to rephrase?", "output": "The pineal gland is a small reddish-brown structure that derives its name from its pinecone-like shape. The pineal ranges in size from 10 to 14 mm; it is located in the midline, above the tentorium and superior colliculi and below the splenium of the corpus callosum and the vein of Galen, and is attached to the superior aspect of the posterior border of the third ventricle. The blood supply of the pineal gland is derived from the posterior cerebral artery from its choroidal branches. The internal cerebral vein drains the blood from the epiphysis cerebri. Histologically the gland consists of cells called pinealocytes and supporting cells.\nPineal gland develops as a diverticulum in the diencephalic roof of the third ventricle during the second month of gestation. The mature gland is suspended from the pineal stalk from the posterior roof of the third ventricle. The pineal secretes melatonin, which is involved in diurnal rhythms.\nDue to the pineal gland's location, any tumor or cyst formation would lead to the compression of the aqueduct of Sylvius. The aqueduct of Sylvius allows the cerebrospinal fluid to circulate out. When there is a blockage in aqueduct of Sylvius by an abnormal pineal gland, the passage of the duct is blocked, and CSF pressure builds up, leading to hydrocephalus. Results in nausea, vomiting, visual changes, headaches, seizures, and memory changes. Increase in intracranial pressure can even be life-threatening, prompting emergency treatment. The hydrocephalus can be relieved by the placement of a VP shunt or ventriculostomy. Vision changes would also occur due to an involvement of the tectal region. The tectal region helps dictate eye movements. Fault in the tectal region causes double vision, an issue with focusing on objects, and eye movement impairment. The pineal gland can cause Parinaud syndrome due to the increasing size of the gland compressing the pretectal area and superior colliculi of the midbrain. Parinaud syndrome prevents a person from moving his or her eyes up and down. The thalamus can be affected, and if so, there can be disturbances on that side of the body which would result in weakness and loss of sensation. The tumor's effect on the hypothalamus will lead to weight gain, disruption of sleep, disruption of temperature control, and water regulation. Cerebellar involvement would result in motor impairment. If the tumor of the pineal gland is present in childhood, then endocrine dysfunctions can also result such as precocious pseudopuberty, diabetes insipidus, and a slowed growth rate."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you explain what Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is?", "output": "The most potent risk factor in the development of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is tuberous sclerosis."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Can you give me a brief summary of septic arthritis?", "output": "X-ray of the joint with septic arthritis are usually normal in the first few days of infection as there is no joint destruction seen usually or may show a preexisting joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.

Rarely it could occur following accidental ingestion of chemicals, such as accidental swallowing of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash during oral procedures.      \nThe most common implicated chemical agents in the pathogenesis of chemical colitis are glutaraldehyde and/or hydrogen peroxide disinfectants. The improper cleaning of the endoscopes allows the disinfectants to remain on the endoscopes, subsequently causing a chemical proctocolitis when the endoscopes are used. The main mechanism for developing chemical colitis is the direct contact of the chemical agent with the mucosa, subsequently causing corrosive injury to the mucosa and activation of the inflammatory pathway. Reactive oxygen formation, lipid peroxidation and vascular smooth muscle contraction also occur in hydrogen peroxide -induced chemical colitis. The primary mucosa toxin in glutaraldehyde is not fully known. However, it may be related to aldehyde. In addition to direct damage, glutaraldehyde is thought to activate arachidonic acid pathway and recruitment of inflammatory cells and substances.  The symptoms of chemical colitis typically develop within 48 hours, often less than 12 hours after introduction of the chemical, but may sometimes take days to weeks when frequent small dilute amount is ingested. \nThere are no identified genetic factors associated with chemical colitis.\nGross pathology findings in most cases shows predominant superficial mucosa involvement. The mucosa is erythematous, friable, edematous with areas of necrosis. Also, multiple shallow mucosal ulcers with fibrinous and/ or purulent exudate and hemorrhage are present.

Diffuse large B cell lymphoma may be classified based on location into nodal and extranodal disease and based on molecular, genetic, and immunohistochemical features into more than 20 subgroups. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma may be classified into 2 subtypes based on gene expression profiles. The progression to diffuse large B cell lymphoma involves the microRNAs (miRNAs). On microscopic histopathological analysis, diffuse large B cell lymphoma can be divided into three variants: centroblastic, immunoblastic, and anaplastic. There are no established causes for diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma among adults, with an annual incidence of 7\u20138 cases per 100,000 people per year. This cancer occurs primarily in older individuals, with a median age of diagnosis at approximately 70 years of age, though it can also occur in children and young adults in rare cases. The most potent risk factor in the development of diffuse large B cell lymphoma is immunodeficiency. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma must be differentiated from other diseases such as follicular lymphoma, Mucosa-Associated Lymphatic Tissue lymphoma (MALT), small cell lymphocytic lymphoma, and Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma depends on the stage of the disease. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is associated with a 5 year survival rate ranging from 70% to more than 90% among children. According to the Lugano classification, there are four stages of diffuse large B cell lymphoma based on the number of nodes involved and extranodal status. The most common symptoms of diffuse large B cell lymphoma include a rapidly enlarging, non-painful mass that may be located in neck, groin or abdomen. The less common symptoms of diffuse large B cell lymphoma include fever, weight loss and drenching night sweats. Common physical examination findings of diffuse large B cell lymphoma include a non tender mass which can arise in virtually any part of the body. Laboratory tests of diffuse large B cell lymphoma include complete blood count, blood chemistry studies, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, cytology, genetic testing, and immunophenotyping.

Chromosomal translocations: MALT lymphoma can arise as a result of many chromosomal translocation. The primary translocations associated with MALToma are the following:   t(1;14) (p22;q32) t(11;18) (q21;q21) t(14;18) (q32;q21) t(3;14) (p14.1;q32) Translocation t(1;14):  It is associated more with MALToma of stomach, lung, and skin. Translocation between BCL10 gene on chromosome 1 and immunoglobulin heavy chain on chromosome 14. BCL10 gene is responsible for preventing apoptosis. This translocation leads to unhindered BCL10 expression and no apoptosis takes place ending up with uncontrolled proliferation of B cells. Patients with t(1;14) are refractory to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy. Translocation t(11;18):   This translocation was mainly reported in MALToma of lung and stomach. It is considered the most common translocation occurs in MALT lymphoma as overall. It has been found associated with lymphoma at other sites as intestine, orbit and salivary glands. This translocation shows fusion of BIRC2 gene on chromosome 11 and MALT1 gene on chromosome 18. BIRC2 is antiapoptotic factor and overexpression can lead to unlimited cell proliferation. Moreover, deletions of both genes have been reported. Deletions lead to DNA breaks which are repaired through a mechanism called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. The NHEJ repair mechanism has a high rate of error that may result in the genetic mutation responsible for the lymphoma. Translocation t(14;18): The translocation occurs between the heavy chain gene of immunoglobulin on chromosome 14 and MALT1 gene on chromosome 18. This occurs mainly in MALT lymphomas outside the gastrointestinal tract. Translocation t(3:14): This translocation has shown a closer position of FOXP1 to the heavy chain gene of immunoglobulins. FOXP1 is a transcription factor which plays a role in suppression of the apoptosis especially the genes suppressing the caspases. General role of the translocation in pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma:   The previous translocations are responsible for activating Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) pathway as well as the uncontrolled expression of BCL10 and MALT1 which are antiapoptic mechanisms. The BCL10 and MALT1 can bind together forming BCL2-MALT1 complex which has an important role in activating NF-kB via activation IkB kinase. When the NF-kB be activate, it translocates into the nucleus to stimulate genes transcriptions especially those which encode growth factors important for cell growth and proliferation. TNFAIP3 gene deletion is another gene mutation associated with adnexal MALToma. It is believed that TNFAIP3 also has an important role in NF-kB pathway activation. TNFAIP3 is normaly a tumor suppressor gene.\nOther somatic mutations: Missense mutations of PIM1 and cMyc are reported with some of the MALT lymphomas.  Framshift mutations of p53 has also been linked with pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas both gastric and extra-gastric.  Card11, CD79B, and Myd88 somatic mutations are also important in NF-kB activation. However, they may be associated with other subtypes of Non-Hodgkin lymphomas as splenic marginal zone lymphoma and noda marginal zone lymphoma."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the condition known as Hunter syndrome?", "output": "Not all people with Hunter syndrome are affected by the disease in exactly the same way, and the rate of symptom progression varies widely.

This process is typically tightly-regulated under physiological conditions via a number of lineage-specific growth factors and lineage-specific growth signaling pathways. The differentiation of myeloid stem cells into mature myelocytes is controlled by lineage-specific transcription factors that regulate the expression of lineage-specific genes. In normal hematopoiesis, the myeloblast is an immature precursor of myeloid white blood cells. A normal myeloblast will gradually mature into a mature white blood cell. Normal hematopoiesis is dependent upon specific growth factor receptors. The two key growth factor receptors involved are as following: Growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity: These are expressed on CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. Examples include receptors for the platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), PDGFR A and B, the receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor (FLT3R), and the receptors for Kit ligand (stem cell factor)  Growth factor receptors without intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity: These depend upon intracellular kinases of the Src and Janus kinase (JAK) families. Examples include the JAK-STAT pathway. \nThe malignant cell in acute myeloid leukemia is the myeloblast. However, in acute myeloid leukemia a single myeloblast accumulates genetic changes, which \"freeze\" the cell in its immature state and prevent differentiation.  This type of mutation alone does not cause leukemia. However, when such a differentiation arrest is combined with other mutations, which disrupt genes controlling proliferation, the result is the uncontrolled growth of an immature clone of cells, leading to the clinical entity of acute myeloid leukemia.  Much of the diversity and heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukemia stems from the fact that leukemic transformation can occur at a number of different steps along the differentiation pathway.  Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy, and the cancer stem cell hypothesis best models the pathophysiology of acute myeloid leukemia. Modern classification schemes for acute myeloid leukemia recognize that the characteristics and behavior of the leukemic cell (and the leukemia) may depend on the stage at which differentiation was halted.\nActivation of tyrosine kinase receptors is followed by signal transduction via intracellular signal cascades leading to alteration of transcription within the cell nucleus.  An important pathway that leads to cellular proliferation is the Ras-MAP Kinase pathway, where Ras is activated by binding of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Ras -bound GTP in turn triggers a cascade of events that finally lead to activation of serine / threonine kinases. Consequently, there is an activation of MAP kinases, which phosphorylate important transcriptional regulators of cell cycle.     As a consequence of these, there is autonomous increased proliferation of cells.\nAltered gene expression leads to autonomous cellular proliferation with defects in regulatory pathways involved in cellular proliferation. Chromosomal translocations and point mutations both play a pivotal role in generating a differentiation blockade on myeloid cells. This results in a disruption in transcription factors. Transcription factors affected by chromosomal rearrangement (translocations) include: Core binding factor complex t(8;21), ETO-AML1 fusion Core binding factor complex inv(16), CBF\u03b2-MYH11 fusion Chromosome 3 translocation t(3;21), RUNX1-EVI1 fusion    Retinoic acid receptor (RAR) fusion t(15;17), PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion   MLL rearrangement Activator protein of Hox gene promoters; Hox gene promoters in turn promote self-renewal of immature myeloid cells  Hox proteins   Point mutations in myeloid transcription factors include: C/EBP\u03b1   PU.1 \nThe increased expression of Bcl-2 pro-survival molecule plays a key role in evasion of programmed cell death in AML.  PI 3-kinase activates the AKT serine/threonine kinase, and this kinase in turn phosphorylates BAD and releases the BCL-2 anti-apoptotic molecule.   The RUNX1-MTG8 fusion protein of AML represses the expression of p14 ARF and promotes destabilization of p53 (a tumor suppressor gene).   \nThe myeloid cells in acute myeolid leukemia have an ability to self-renew without being committed to a specific cell lineage.  The self-renewing capacity of myeloid cells in AMLs is thought to be mediated by the following: Fusion of ALK tyrosine kinase with nucleophosmin protein (NPM)  Mutation of FLT3-ITD   RUNX1-MTG8, PML-RAR\u03b1, and PLZF-RAR\u03b1 fusions can all induce the expression of \u03b2-catenin and \u03b3-catenin (plako-globin) proteins   The Wnt signalling pathway has also been shown to be involved in self-renewal of myeloid cells \nThe pathophysiology of acute promyelocytic leukemia begins with a balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocation in hematopoietic stem cells. The chromosomal translocation involves the juxtaposition of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha gene (RARA) on the long arm of chromosome 17 with another gene (most commonly the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) on the long arm of chromosome 15).  The translocation is designated as t(15;17)(q22;q12). The PML-RARA fusion product is a transcriptional regulator and binds to retinoic acid response elements in the promoter regions of the genome. The PML-RARA fusion product serves to recruit co-repressors of gene transcription, preventing myeloid differentiation.  This is known as a differentiation block, since the cells are unable to differentiate into normal mature cells. The cells remain primitive and stem-like, which is the basis for the malignancy. The result of the chromosomal translocation is ineffective blood cell production and uncontrolled proliferation of malignant promyelocytes.  In 95% of cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia, the translocation involved PML and RARA. However, it is important to note that RARA has multiple other binding partners which can lead to the development or acute promyelocytic leukemia, as shown in the table below.\nTranslocation Partner Chromosomal Location Function Response to Therapy Other Features PML 15q24.1 A member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family Localizes to nucleolar bodies and functions as a transcription factor and tumor suppressor Regulate p53 response to oncogenic growth signals Influenced by the cell cycle Sensitive to all- trans retinoic acid  Most common translocation Found in 70-90% of cases  PLZF (ZBTB16)   11q23.2 Encodes a zinc finger transcription factor Involved in cell cycle regulation Interacts with histone deacetylases Resistant to all- trans retinoic acid  Second most common translocation (after PML-RARA) NPM1 5q35.1 Encodes nucleophosmin 1 (a nucleolar shuttle protein) Involved in centromere duplication Serves a protein chaperone Regulates the cell cycle Sequesters the tumor suppressor ARF in the nucleus and protects ARF from degradation Sensitive to all- trans retinoic acid  NPM1 mutation carries a favorable prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia Rare translocation NUMA  11q13.4 Contributes to a structural component of the nuclear matrix Interacts with microtubules Contributes to mitotic spindle formation during cell division Sensitive to all- trans retinoic acid  Rare translocation STAT5B  17q21.2 Encodes a signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) Serves an intracellular transduction molecule for cytokine signaling Translocates to the nucleus and functions as a transcription factor Involved in T cell receptor signaling Involved in apoptosis Sequesters the tumor suppressor ARF in the nucleus and protects ARF from degradation Resistant to all- trans retinoic acid  Rare translocation"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the definition of uremic pericarditis?", "output": "Pericarditis in renal failure occurs in approximately in 13 percent of patients who are on maintenance hemodialysis .

Presence of ascites is an important risk factor for the development of bacterial translocation. In healthy individuals, bacteria that colonize lymph nodes are killed by local immune defenses. However, in the setting of cirrhosis, an acquired state of immunodeficiency there is: malfunctioning of the reticulo-endothelial and neutrophilic system, reduced cellular and humoral bactericidal function which favor the spread of bacteria to the blood stream.   \nAlterations in the systemic immune response: Bacteremia in a healthy host results in rapid coating of the bacteria by IgG / complement components which help in engulfing and killing of the bacteria by circulating neutrophils. But in cirrhosis, several abnormalities have been described which lead to defective clearance of the bacteria include: decreased serum levels of complement components (C3, C4), impaired chemotaxis, poor function and phagocytic activity of neutrophils, decreased function of Fc-gamma-receptors in macrophages. Reticuloendothelial system phagocytic activity: The stationary macrophages, such as the Kupffer cells of the liver, assist the circulating neutrophils in the extraction and killing of particulate matter (e.g., bacteria) from the systemic circulation. In Cirrhosis, there is hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) dysfunction and kupffer cells are decreased in number with impaired function along with the malfunctioning of the neutrophilic system. Patients with the most severe dysfunction of RES are at highest risk of bacteremia and concomitant shortened survival, due to sepsis. The presence of intrahepatic and extra hepatic porto-systemic shunts as a consequence of portal hypertension, prevent circulating bacteria from encountering kupffer cells. The final consequence of these abnormalities is the prolongation of bacteremia and eventual seeding of other sites, including ascitic fluid.  Ascitic fluid defense mechanisms, decreased local AF opsonic activity: The presence of bacteria in ascitic fluid does not guarantee infection will develop, as ascitic fluid is capable of humoral self-defense due to the effectiveness of the complement system and patients with adequate activity of this vital bactericidal system do not develop AF bacterial infections. In patients with ascitic fluid C3 < 1g/dl and a protein level < 1g/dl are at an increased predisposition to SBP. The complement levels may be deficient because of increased consumption of these components or because of impaired synthesis, resulting in colonization of AF by bacteria. The decreased antimicrobial ability and can eventually lead to the development of infection bacteremia / endotoxemia leading to activation of cytokine cascade.

The poor sanitation is associated with Tropheryma whipplei infection. \nIt is believed that human being is the only host for this bacterium. \nTropheryma whipplei invades intestines primarily and then every other organ including the heart, CNS, joints, lymph nodes, lungs, eyes, kidneys, bone marrow, and skin. Tissues are infected by macrophage infiltration contaminated by Tropheryma whipplei. Tropheryma whipplei multiplies in macrophages and monocytes.  Although there is a massive infiltration of the intestinal mucosa with the bacteria, the immunologic response is not adequate to limit the infection. Bacterium-infected macrophages express less CD11b which leads to inappropriate antigen presentation. These macrophages are unable to turn into mature phagosomes and lower the thioredoxin expression. The impairment in T-helper 1 cells differentiation leads to the inability of the immune system to kill the bacteria.  \nTropheryma whipplei infection causes four different clinical manifestations: acute infection, asymptomatic carrier state, the classic Whipple\u2019s disease, and localized chronic infection.  \nIt is believed that host immunologic response to Tropheryma whipplei plays an important role on the clinical manifestation of the disease. \nSeveral studies suggested that the defective cellular immunity and humoral immunity may lead to the proliferation of the bacteria and clinical manifestation of the Whipple's disease. \nFollowings are some of the observations that indicate the immunologic nature of the Whipple's disease:\nReduced T cell proliferative response  Decreased CD4 / CD8 ratio  Decreased T helper cells type 1 response and subsequently reduced production of interleukin 2 (IL-2) Enhanced expression of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and functional activity of T helper cells type 2 (Th2)  Increased numbers of regulatory T cells  Reduced peripheral T cell proliferation to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A  Up-regulated Interleukin 16 (IL-16) in monocyte -derived macrophages that enhanced Tropheryma whipplei replication \nReduced Interleukin 12 (IL-12) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells that leads to decreased functional activity of T helper cells type 1 (Th1) and subsequently decreased Interferon gamma secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells    Reduced expression of complement receptor 3 (CD11b)  Normal phagocytosis but impaired degradation \nIncreased Immunoglobulin M production in the lamina propria \nReduced Serum Immunoglobulin G2, an Interferon gamma dependent immunoglobulin subclass, and serum TGF-beta levels"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you explain what Cohen syndrome is?", "output": "The signs and symptoms vary due to variable expression.

This section pertains solely to primary erythromelalgia as the secondary form is too poorly understood.\nThere are 10 known mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel \u03b1-subunit Na V 1.7 encoding gene, SCN9A. This channel is expressed primarily in nociceptors of the dorsal root ganglion and the sympathetic ganglion neurons. 9 of these mutations have received further study and they have all shown to result in similar biophysical alterations, Table 1. As can be seen from table 1, the primary effect of erythromelalgia mutations is Na V 1.7 channels that activate at more hyperpolarized potentials. Na V 1.7 channels act largely as threshold sensors and initiate action potentials. Consequently, this shift in their activation profile results in channels that open closer to the resting membrane potential. In many mutations, this shift of activation is accompanied by shifts in the voltage sensitivity of fast and/or slow inactivation, often in the depolarized direction. This results in channels that are open for a longer period of time, producing larger and more prolonged changes in membrane potential.\nSome of these mutant channels have been expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) or sympathetic neurons. In DRG neurons expressing the F1449V mutation, a lower threshold is required for action potential creation (93.1 \u00b1 12.0 pA) than those expressing wild-type channels (124.1 \u00b1 7.4 pA). Furthermore, while DRG neurons expressing wild-type channels only respond with a few action potentials, those expressing F1449V channels respond with a high-frequency train of action potentials.  There is a similar effect in DRG neurons expressing the L858H and A863P mutants. Here, there is also a notable change in resting membrane potential, being depolarized by 4-7 mV versus wild-type channel expressing cells.   The situation is different, however, in sympathetic neurons expressing the L858H mutation. While L858H expressing sympathetic ganglion are depolarized ~5mV relative to wild-type expressing neurons, their threshold for action potential initially is notably higher. Furthermore, while current injection of 40pA for 950ms provokes an average of 6 action potentials in sympathetic neurons expressing wild-type channels this stimulation evokes only approximately 2 action potentials with reduced overshoots in sympathetic neurons expressing L858H mutant channels. Further investigation has demonstrated that the differences in response between DRG and sympathetic neurons is due to expression of Na V 1.8 in the former. Consequently, expression of Na V 1.8 channels in sympathetic neurons also expressing L858H mutant Na V 1.7 results in neurons with a depolarized resting membrane potential that nevertheless have a normal action potential threshold and overshoot. \nAn effective, though not recommended, treatment for erythromelalgia symptoms is cooling of the affected area. Activation of wild-type channels in unaffected by cooling. L858F mutant channels, however, are activated at more depolarized potentials when cooled than at normal body temperature. At 16\u00baC the activation V \u00bd of the mutant channel is only 4.6mV more hyperpolarized that wild-type versus 9.6mV more hyperpolarized at 35\u00baC. Fast inactivation is affected in a similar manner in both wild-type and L858F mutant channel and is, thus, unlikely to contribute to symptom resolution due to cooling. While such cooling is unlikely to affect neuronal cell bodies, axons and termini express Na V 1.7 and are present in the skin."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What diagnostic studies are performed for traumatic brain injury?", "output": "There are no other imaging findings associated with traumatic brain injury."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the historical background of adrenal carcinoma?", "output": "There is limited information about the historical perspective of disease name.\nOR\nDisease name was first discovered by name of scientist, a nationality + occupation, in year/during/following event.\nThe association between important risk factor/cause and disease name was made in/during year/event.

It arises from two directions. On one hand, the precursor of the ureter buds from the Wolffian duct, while on the other hand, the precursor of the renal tubules develop from the metanephrogenic blastema. The ureteric bud subsequently grows into the latter mass, forming the parts of the nephron. Other changes include e.g. the translocation of the ureteric opening directly into the cloaca.\nThe rudiments of the permanent kidneys make their appearance about the end of the first or the beginning of the second month. Each kidney originate as an ureteric bud from the caudal end of the Wolffian duct, which, in turn, originates from intermediate mesoderm. The ureteric bud starts close to where the Wolffian duct opens into the cloaca, and grows dorsalward and rostralward along the posterior abdominal wall, where its blind extremity expands and subsequently divides into several buds, which form the rudiments of the renal pelvis and renal calyces; by continued growth and subdivision it gives rise to the collecting duct system of the kidney. The other, more superficial, portion of the diverticulum, on the other hand, becomes the ureter.\nThe renal corpuscles and renal tubules, in contrast, are developed from the metanephrogenic blastema instead of from the ureteric bud. The metanephrogenic blastema is moulded over the growing end of the latter, and becomes a part of the metanephros in this way. The renal tubules of the metanephros, unlike those of the pronephros and mesonephros, do not open into the Wolffian duct. Instead, the tubules rapidly elongate to form the parts of the nephron: the proximal tubules, the loops of Henle and the distal convoluted tubules. These last join and establish communications with the collecting duct system derived from the ultimate ramifications of the ureteric bud. In the other end, the renal tubules give rise to Bowman's capsules and glomeruli.\nThe mesoderm around the tubules becomes condensed to form the connective tissue of the kidney. The ureter opens at first into the hind-end of the Wolffian duct; after the sixth week it separates from the Wolffian duct, and opens independently into the part of the cloaca which ultimately becomes the urinary bladder. The renal tubules become arranged into renal pyramids, and the lobulated condition of the kidneys exists for some time after birth, while traces of it may be found even in the adult. The kidney of the ox and many other animals, on the other hand, remains lobulated throughout life."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the significance of a CT scan in detecting hemorrhagic stroke?", "output": "CT is very sensitive for identifying acute hemorrhage and is considered the gold standard."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the importance of MRI in the diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia?", "output": "MRI may be performed to detect metastasis of choriocarcinoma to brain and spinal cord."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you please tell me what autoimmune retinopathy means?", "output": "Autoimmune retinopathy (AIR) is an autoimmune retinal degenerative disease caused by serum autoantibodies cross reacting against the retinal, and retinal like antigens.\nThere are a significant number of anti-retinal antibodies that are associated with AIR, these include antibodies to anti- recoverin, anti-alpha- enolase, anti- transducin, anti-CAII, anti-arrestin, anti-rhodopsin, anti-Muller glial cells, anti-mitofilin, anti-tintin, anti-COX.

There are several approaches you and your family can use to prevent and control Lyme disease:\nPreventing Tick Bites\nWhile it is a good idea to take preventive measures against ticks year-round, be extra vigilant in warmer months (April-September) when ticks are most active.\nAvoid Direct Contact with Ticks\nAvoid wooded and bushy areas with high grass and leaf litter. Walk in the center of trails.\nRepel Ticks with DEET or Permethrin\nUse repellents that contain 20% or more DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) on the exposed skin for protection that lasts up to several hours. Always follow product instructions. Parents should apply this product to their children, avoiding hands, eyes, and mouth. Use products that contain permethrin on clothing.

Vaccines are not available for all the tickborne diseases that dogs can get, and they don\u2019t keep the dogs from bringing ticks into your home. For these reasons, it\u2019s important to use a tick preventive product on your dog.\nTick bites on dogs may be hard to detect. Signs of tickborne disease may not appear for 7-21 days or longer after a tick bite, so watch your dog closely for changes in behavior or appetite if you suspect that your pet has been bitten by a tick.\nTo reduce the chances that a tick will transmit disease to you or your pets:\nCheck your pets for ticks daily, especially after they spend time outdoors. If you find a tick on your dog, remove it right away. Ask your veterinarian to conduct a tick check at each exam. Talk to your veterinarian about tickborne diseases in your area. Reduce tick habitat in your yard. Talk with your veterinarian about using tick preventives on your pet.\nNote: Cats are extremely sensitive to a variety of chemicals.

These benefits have been best-studied for Ixodes scapularis (the black-legged tick), and include:\nConsistent and timely pest control Easy to apply Relatively inexpensive Safe if applied according to the label\nOnly small amounts of acaricide applied at the right time of year are necessary. Application should focus on control of nymphal I. scapularis ticks, the stage most likely to transmit Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis, by spraying once in May or early June. An October application of acaricide may be used to control adult blacklegged ticks, however, they less commonly transmit disease. The use and timing of acaricides to control other ticks of public health concern is less well studied, but may still be helpful.\nIf you have health concerns about applying acaricides:\nCheck with local health or agricultural officials about the best time to apply acaricide in your area. Identify rules and regulations related to pesticide application on residential properties (Environmental Protection Agency and your state determine the availability of pesticides). Consider using a professional pesticide company to apply pesticides at your home.\nCreate a Tick-safe Zone to Reduce Ticks in the Yard\nThe Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has developed a comprehensive Tick Management Handbook PDF - 8.53 MB for preventing tick bites. Here are some simple landscaping techniques that can help reduce tick populations:\nRemove leaf litter. Clear tall grasses and brush around homes and at the edge of lawns. Place a 3-ft wide barrier of wood chips or gravel between lawns and wooded areas to restrict tick migration into recreational areas. Mow the lawn frequently. Stack wood neatly and in a dry area (discourages rodents). Keep playground equipment, decks, and patios away from yard edges and trees.

So it is hoped with further developments these will become more effective against pneumonia.\nVaccination of patients with AECB in the autumn months is thought to have a positive effect in reducing the severity and number of exacerbations over winter. The oral vaccine described in this review was able to decrease the carriage or non- typeable Haemophilus influenzae that is a common cause of exacerbations to chronic bronchitis. With good planing and further research these types of vaccines may reduce the burden associated with lower respiratory diseases.\nThere are few treatments available for viral forms of bronchitis and pneumonia. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the main cause of these in children, could be potentially treated using a new monoclonal antibody (mAb) Motavizumab. In animal trials it reduced antibody titres 100 times lower than the only drug currently available to treat the condition.

When freshly passed in stool, the oocyst is not infective (thus, direct fecal-oral transmission cannot occur, which differentiates Cyclospora from other important coccidian parasites such as Cryptosporidium). Under adequate temperatures (23-32\u00baC), oocysts take about 7-15 days to sporulate and become infectious. After ingestion, oocysts excyst to release elongated sporozoites. Sporozoites then infect epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly those of the duodenum and jejunum. The sporozoites undergo asexual reproduction giving rise to meronts type I and II, which then differentiate into gametocytes. Gametocytes are fertilized to produce a zygote.   Inside cells, zygotes undergo asexual reproduction and development to mature into oocysts, which are shed in the stool.  C. cayetanensis oocysts have also been isolated from non- gastrointestinal sites, such as sputum, especially in immunocompromised patients with HIV and concomitant TB. This led to the hypothesis that C. cayetanensis may be an opportunistic pathogen. \nC. cayetanensis is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Individuals are infected with Cyclospora by ingesting sporulated oocysts (infective form of the parasite). This occurs most commonly when food or water contaminated with human fecal material is consumed. The parasite is shed in the feces of infected persons in the unsporulated oocyst form (non-infective) and, in a favorable environment, sporulate and become infective.

Template:WikiDoc Sources"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the upcoming or experimental treatments for low-density lipoprotein?", "output": "The function of PCSK9 was first described in 2003 when a gain-of-function mutation of PCSK9 gene (leading to increased activity) was associated with familial hypercholesterolemia in 4 french families.  The association was further clarified in 2005 after the discovery of loss-of-function mutations of PCSK9 in patients with low LDL-C. This loss-of-function was linked to a 40% reduction in plasma levels of LDL-C in the studied population.  PCSK9 has a major role in the metabolism of hepatic cholesterol. It is a serine protease that binds to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), inducing LDLR degradation in the lysosomes. Reduced LDL receptor levels result in decreased metabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL), which could lead to hypercholesterolemia.  The sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), which is activated in the presence of low intracellular levels of cholesterol, also induces the expression of PCSK9, thereby increasing the amount of circulating LDL-cholesterol.  Several drugs have been investigated for the inhibition of PCSK9, and have demonstrated a more potent lowering of LDL cholesterol levels than the current available drugs. Phase II and phase III trials have demonstrated good tolerability and efficacy in lowering LDL choleterol, with exploratory analyses demonstrating a reduction in cardiovascular events . Although it is biologically plausible that this reduction in LDL would also lead to a reduction in atherothrombotic events, additional clinical trials are ongoing to determine the efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors in improving CV outcomes.    \nPCSK9 Function Pharmacologic Interventions for PCSK9 inhibition\nFor more information regarding this approach to lipid management, click here. For details about specific agents, click on the following links: Alirocumab, Evolocumab, Bococizumab\nMicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein is an endosomal protein found in the hepatocytes and intestinal enterocytes. It catalyses the transfer of cholesterol esters and triglycerides to nascent apo B, leading to the formation of chylomicron and VLDL in the intestine and hepatocyte, respectively.  Chylomicrons and other apo-B48-containing remnant lipoproteins are essential for intestinal fat absorption and its transfer to peripheral tissues. Mutations of the MTTP gene leads to a condition known as abetalipoproteinemia, which causes an absence of apo-B-containing lipoproteins and very low levels of LDL-C and triglycerides.   Individuals with this recessive condition have severe intestinal malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) manifesting as fatty liver, night-blindness, rickets or osteomalacia, neuropathy, ataxia, and coagulopathy.\nSeveral MTP inhibitors are being investigated:\nNon-intestinal-specific agents Lomitapide (AEGR-427, previously known as BMS-201038 - Bristol-Myers-Squibb) by Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Implitapide (formerly AEGR-427 or Bayer BAY-13-9952) CP-34086 by Pfizer Intestinal-specific agents Dirlotapide by Pfizer JTT-130 and SLx-4090 by Surface Logix.\nEarly clinical trials that enrolled patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia demonstrated up to 50% reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C and apo B with MTP inhibition.  However, higher doses were associated with transient elevations in liver transaminases and hepatic fat accumulation. Further developments of CP-34086 and implitapide have been placed on hold due to their hepatic adverse effects. Intestinal-specific agents such as dirlotapide, JTT-130, and SLx-4090 were developed to prevent the hepatic effects of the non-specific agents. Thus far, these agents are still early in human clinical trials (except dirlotapide), but several reports have demonstrated significant reductions in postprandial triglyceridemia and total cholesterol in preclinical studies.  Intestinal-specific MTP inhibitors may be effective in treating hyperchylomicronemia but their efficacy as LDL-C lowering agents is uncertain.\nApolipoprotein B (apo B) is a large protein that is present in all atherogenic lipoproteins i.e., VLDL, LDL, IDL. There is a single copy of apo B-100 in all these lipoproteins, therefore, plasma levels of apo B-100 are proportionate to the concentration of circulating atherogenic lipoproteins and are associated with a higher cardiovascular risk.  Apo B exists in two main isoforms, apo B100 and apo B48. The liver synthesizes apo B-100, whereas the small intestine synthesizes apo B48. Apo B100 serves two main functions - (1) it provides structural stability to the circulating lipoproteins, and (2) it acts as a ligand for LDL receptors (LDLR). On the other hand, apo B48 is a unique structural protein of chylomicrons that originate from the small intestine. The removal of LDL particles from the plasma involves the binding of apo B to LDLR, then, the resulting apo B-100-LDLR complex gets internalized into the hepatocyte for processing.  Mutations that lower the affinity of apo B-100 for LDLR result in decreased clearance of LDLs, a condition known as familial defective apo B, which is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.  In contrast, mutations in apo B that decrease its translation or secretion have been demonstrated to reduce circulating LDL-C and improve cardiovascular risk.  All of these observations have led to the development of therapeutic strategies that target Apo-B for the reduction of LDL cholesterol.\nISIS 301012 or mipomersen, by ISIS Pharmaceuticals, is a second-generation 20 nucleotide antisense oligoneucleotide (ASO) which selectively inhibits apo B gene expression via RNAse H activation.  ASOs are short, deoxyribonucleotide strands which bind to the targeted mRNAs to inhibit their translation leading to their enzymatic degradation by ribonuclease (RNAse H or argonaute 2), thus inhibiting gene expression.  Phases I and II clinical trials of ISIS301012 have demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in plasma apo B levels by approximately 40% and up to 50% reduction in LDL-C with subcutaneously administered ISIS-301012 or mipomersen, even among patients with defective LDLRs.    Furthermore, a randomized phase III trial that enrolled homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients demonstrated a 15% elevation in HDL-C.  Despite its efficacy in lowering LDL-C, mipomersen did not receive approval due to a significant increase in adverse effects - injection site reactions (80-100% of patients), flu-like illness, and 3-fold elevation in liver transaminases (15%).\nThe association between thyroid hormones and cholesterol metabolism was first discovered in the 1930s, and its use as a cholesterol lowering agent has been investigated in several studies.    However, the development of thyromimetic agents was set back by the associated increase in cardiovascular events, thought to be related to contamination of the thyromimetic agent investigated with levothyroxine (LT4), as well as the discovery of statins.   The discovery of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) restored some of the investigations into thyromimetics for the reduction of LDL-C. There are two main TRs in humans:\nTR\u03b1 receptors (TR\u03b1 1 & 2). TR\u03b1 1 is predominantly in the muscles and adipose tissue; also mediates the cardiovascular responses to thyroid hormones such as tachycardia.  TR\u03b2 receptors (TR\u03b2 1 & 2). TR\u03b2 1 is mainly in the liver and it regulates cholesterol homeostasis.  Therefore, the development of TR\u03b2 1-specific thyromimetic would be a promising method of cholesterol management devoid of cardiac effects.  \nSome of the proposed mechanisms of action of these agents include:\nUpregualtion of hepatic LDLR expression by TR\u03b2.   Stimulation of bile acid synthesis through the upregulation of the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7-hydroxylase CYP7A1) Stimulation of biliary excretion (through increased expression of ATP-binding cassette proteins G5/G8 ABCG5/G8 Promotion of reverse cholesterol transport which ultimately increases the formation of HDL, enhances cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity, and increases scavenger receptor B-I (SR-BI) activity for the uptake of cholesterol.\nExamples of TR\u03b2 1-specific thyromimetics that had been investigated include:\nDITPA (3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid) - terminated Eprotirome (KB2115)  by Karo Bio AB. Sobetirome (GC-1) MB07811 KB-141 T-0681\nSimilar to the statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors), inhibitors of squalene synthase prevent the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to squalene at a point on the HMG-CoA-Mevalonate pathway which represents the commitment of cholesterol intermediates to the synthesis of cholesterol. Squalene synthase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit cholesterol production, reduce triglyceride synthesis and apoB secretion, increase LDL receptor expression and LDL uptake in HepG2 cells.  However, they are less likely to be associated with the adverse myopathic effects commonly observed with statins because they do not cause depletion of isoprenoid intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and as a result, they do not limit the prenylation or lipidation (addition of hydrophobic molecules to a protein) of membrane-directed proteins. \nTAK-475 (lapaquistat acetate) by Takeda Pharmaceuticals was the first squalene synthase inhibitor to reach phase III clinical trials for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the United States and Europe. Randomized, double-blinded, placebo and actively controlled, parallel-group studies involving TAK-475 alone and in combination with atovastatin were associated with a dose-dependent reduction of LDL-C up to 27% and 19% when compared with placebo and when combined with atovastatin, respectively in healthy human volunteers. Recent animal studies have demonstrated a protective effect against statin-induced myopathy when isoprenoid intermediates are replenished directly or by the use of TAK-475 given with high-dose statins.  Results from these studies further underscore squalene synthase inhibitors as potential drugs to clinically prevent statin-induced myopathies.\nPhase III multi-centered clinical trials are on-going to compare TAK-475 vs simvastatin alone or in combination, vs. ezetimibe, and as add-on in patients already on atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or a low or high-dose statin. It will also be investigated as add-on treatment in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nETC-1002 (8-hydroxy-2,2,14,14-tetramethylpentadecanedioic acid), by Esperion Therapeutics, is a small molecule which regulates lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. It modulates the activity of two distinct molecular targets - hepatic adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).  It works by:\nInhibition of ACL - Inhibition of adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase, an enzyme responsible for the production of ATP citrate, reduces the levels of acetyl co-enzyme A (acetyl-CoA - an important precursor to HMG-CoA which is a vital component in cholesterol and ketone synthesis). It acts on the lipid synthesis pathway upstream of HMG CoA reductase - the molecular targets of statins.  Activation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMP-activated protein kinase) - AMP-activated protein kinase is a functional enzyme present in the liver, striated muscle, and the brain. It plays a key role in cellular energy homeostasis. It acts as a sensor of the energy-depleted form of ATP (i.e., AMP), and its activation results in stimulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, and triglyceride synthesis, inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis and lipogenesis, stimulation of skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose uptake,  and modulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells. \nIn a phase II clinical trial involving 177 patients, ETC-1002 was shown to have a dose-dependent reduction of up to 27% in LDL-C (compared with placebo) observed with the maximum dose (120mg), devoid of serious adverse effects.  This approach may represent a new target mechanism to reducing LDL-C, but additional studies are required to determine the safety due to its high possibility of producing similar adverse effects as statins.\nSterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors required in the activation of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. Fatostatin, a diarylthiazole derivative, was observed to impair the activation of SREBPs, thereby decreasing the transcription of lipogenic genes in cells.  More studies are required regarding the efficacy of this potential target in reducing circulating LDL-C since it also induces the expression of PCSK9 - a serine protease which promotes degradation of LDLR, thereby preventing the clearing of LDL particles from the plasma."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the underlying physiological process of cystic fibrosis?", "output": "In cystic fibrosis, 98% of men are infertile.

A patient has a 50% chance of passing the disorder onto his/her offspring, presuming that his/her partner does not also carry the mutation.\nHereditary spherocytosis is caused by a variety of molecular defects in the genes that code for spectrin, ankyrin, protein 4.1, and other erythrocyte membrane proteins. These proteins are necessary to maintain the normal shape of an erythrocyte, which is a biconcave disk. The protein that is most commonly defective is ankyrin. As the spleen normally targets abnormally shaped red cells (which are typically older), it also destroys spherocytes. Because the cell skeleton has a defect, the blood cell contracts to its most surface-tension efficient and least flexible configuration, a sphere, rather than the more flexible donut-shape. The sphere-shaped red blood cells are known as spherocytes.\nThough the spherocytes have a smaller surface area through which oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged, they in themselves perform adequately to maintain healthy oxygen supplies. However, they have a high osmotic fragility--when placed into water, they are more likely to burst than normal red blood cells. These cells are more prone to physical degradation. They are most commonly found in immunologically-mediated hemolytic anemias and in hereditary spherocytosis, but the former would have a positive direct Coombs test and the latter would not. The misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the spleen for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down, causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply (auto- hemolysis)."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is Gliomatosis cerebri?", "output": "Gliomatosis cerebri was first reported by Landau in 1910.

ADA is used for diagnosing tuberculosis in endemic countries where TB diagnostic procedures are expensive. ADA isoenzymes are more accurate. For both pleural TB and TB meningitis, ADA has a high degree of sensitivity.\nThis is a heterogeneous group of tests that use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect mycobacterial nucleic acid. These test vary in which nucleic acid sequence they detect and vary in their accuracy. The two most common commercially available tests are the amplified mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test (MTD, Gen-Probe) and Amplicor (Roche Diagnostics). The CDC recommends that NAA testing should be performed on a respiratory specimen from each patient with signs and symptoms of active pulmonary TB disease for whom a diagnosis of TB is being considered (i.e., TB suspect), but has not been established. NAA testing does not replace the need for AFB smear and culture. All current guidelines and recommendations for culture-based testing should remain in effect, especially recommended turn around times for culture and DST. A single positive NAA test result can support the diagnosis of TB in a patient for whom there is a reasonable index of suspicion. This result should trigger reporting to public health officials, initiation of treatment if not already started, and intensified efforts to obtain an isolate for drug susceptibility testing. In a patient with little suspicion of having active TB, a single positive NAA test result should be viewed with suspicion (i.e., a possible false-positive result) and interpreted in the same way as a single culture-positive result, i.e., by correlating the results with other diagnostic findings. A single negative NAA test result should never be used as a definitive test to exclude TB, especially in suspects with a moderate to high clinical suspicion of TB. Rather, the negative NAA test result should be used as additional information to aid in making clinical decisions to expedite a work-up for an alternative diagnosis or to prevent unnecessary use of TB treatment in suspects with a low clinical suspicion.. The FDA -approved NAA tests for TB have slightly less sensitivity than culture-isolation methods, and the 15% to 20% of U.S. TB cases that are reported with negative culture results may also have negative NAA test results. Thus, a negative NAA test result does not exclude the diagnosis of TB. Further research is needed before specific recommendations can be made on the use of NAA testing in the diagnosis of TB in children who cannot produce sputum and in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB, although there is much anecdotal evidence of the utility of such testing in individual cases."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What other imaging findings are associated with Uveitis?", "output": "There are no other diagnostic imaging findings associated with uveitis."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What information pertains to Glycogen-caused Type II storage disease?", "output": "Type I glycogen storage disease (GSD II) is also called Pompe disease.\nCori disease is a condition in which the body cannot break down glycogen in lysosomes.

This effect is achieved through activation of the GPCR AT1, which signals through a Gq protein to activate Phospholipase C, and subsequently increase intracellular calcium. \nAngiotensin II has prothrombotic potential through adhesion and aggregation of platelets and stimulation of PAI-1 and PAI-2.  \nWhen cardiac cell growth is stimulated, a local (autocrine-paracrine) renin\u2013angiotensin system is activated in the cardiac myocyte, which stimulates cardiac cell growth through protein kinase C.

Elevated plasma angiotensin II levels are responsible for the elevated aldosterone levels present during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.\nAngiotensin II has a direct effect on the proximal tubules to increase Na + reabsorption. It has a complex and variable effect on glomerular filtration and renal blood flow depending on the setting. Increases in systemic blood pressure will maintain renal perfusion pressure; however, constriction of the afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles will tend to restrict renal blood flow. The effect on the efferent arteriolar resistance is, however, markedly greater, in part due to its smaller basal diameter; this tends to increase glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and maintain glomerular filtration rate. A number of other mechanisms can affect renal blood flow and GFR. High concentrations of Angiotensin II can constrict the glomerular mesangium, reducing the area for glomerular filtration. Angiotensin II is a sensitizer to tubuloglomerular feedback, preventing an excessive rise in GFR. Angiotensin II causes the local release of prostaglandins, which, in turn, antagonize renal vasoconstriction.

Reports of death from accute hepatotoxicity have been reported to be as low as 2.5 grams over a 24 hour period. Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (N -acetyl- p -benzoquinone imine NAPQI, or NABQI) which is produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver.  In normal circumstances this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with glutathione in phase 2 reaction. In overdose large amount of NAPQI is generated which overwhelm the detoxification process and lead to damage to liver cells. Nitric oxide also plays role in inducing toxicity.  The risk of liver injury is influenced by several factors including the dose ingested, concurrent alcohol or other drug intake, interval between ingestion and antidote etc. The dose toxic to liver is quite variable and is lower in chronic alcoholics. Measurement of blood level is important in assessing prognosis, higher level predicting worse prognosis. Administration of Acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. Those who develop acute liver failure can still recover spontaneously, but may require transplantation if poor prognostic signs such as encephalopathy or coagulopathy is present (see King's College Criteria). Acetaminophen (3D structure) overdose is the most common cause of drug induced liver disease\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Although individual analgesics rarely induce liver damage, due to their widespread use NSAIDs have emerged as a major group of drugs exhibiting hepatotoxicity. Both dose dependent and idiosyncratic reactions have been documented.  Aspirin and phenylbutazone are associated with intrinsic hepatotoxicity; idiosyncratic reaction has been associated with ibuprofen, sulindac, phenylbutazone, piroxicam, diclofenac and indomethacin.\nGlucocorticoids: Glucocorticoids are so named due to their effect on carbohydrate mechanism. they promote glycogen storage in liver. Enlarged liver is a rare side effect of long term steroid use in children.  The classical effect of prolonged use both in adult and paediatric population is steatosis. \nIsoniazid: Isoniazide (INH) is one of the most commonly used drug for tuberculosis; it is associated with mild elevation of liver enzymes in up to 20% of patients and severe hepatotoxicity in 1-2% of patients. \nNatural products like: Amanita mushroom, particularly the destroying angels, aflatoxins\nIndustrial toxins like: Arsenic, carbon tetra chloride, vinyl chloride\nHerbal and alternative remedies like: Ackee fruit, bajiaolian, camphor, copaltra, cycasin, kava, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, horse chestnut leaf, valerian, comfrey (often used in herbal tea) \nChinese herbal remedies like: Jin Bu Huan, Ma-Huang, Sho-Wu-Pian\nFly agaric (Amanita muscaria) is one of the natural products toxic to the liver Horse chestnut leaf Ackee fruit Saint John's wort Induces Cytochrome P-450 enzyme"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you explain what progressive supranuclear palsy is?", "output": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (or the Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, after the Canadian physicians who described it in 1963  ) is a rare brain disorder that causes serious and permanent problems with control of gait and balance. The most obvious sign of the disease is an inability to aim the eyes properly, which occurs because of lesions in the area of the brain that coordinates eye movements. Some patients describe this effect as a blurring. PSP patients often show alterations of mood and behavior, including depression and apathy as well as progressive mild dementia. It must be emphasized that the pattern of signs and symptoms can be quite different from person to person. The symptoms of PSP are caused by a gradual deterioration of brain cells in a few tiny but important places at the base of the brain, in the region called the brainstem. PSP is often misdiagnosed because some of its symptoms are very much like those of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and more rare neurodegenerative disorders, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The key to establishing the diagnosis of PSP is the identification of early gait instability and difficulty moving the eyes, the hallmark of the disease, as well as ruling out other similar disorders, some of which are treatable. Although PSP gets progressively worse, no one dies from PSP itself.\nThe sexes are affected approximately equally and there is no racial, geographical or occupational predilection.

To better help in the prediction of the evolution of the cardiogenic shock along with the prognosis of the patient, some important facts are relevant to underline: CS occurs in 8% of hospitalized STEMI patients, with a mortality rate of 50-60% within 30 days.  CS carries a very poor prognosis, particularly in the elderly. In the GUSTO 1 trial, the following were identified as correlates of higher mortality among patients with CS:  Older age Prior MI Signs of hypoperfusion including cold and clammy skin Altered mental state Oliguria CS is associated with more severe lesions of the coronary territories, with 53% of patients in the SHOCK trial suffering from disease in three coronary arteries and 16% with predominant left main coronary artery disease.  The mortality rate in CS is significantly higher when the culprit lesion is located in the left main coronary artery or saphenous vein graft, compared to those with lesions located in the circumflex, left anterior descending, or right coronary artery.  Among the causes of CS following MI, ventricular septal rupture has one of the highest mortality rates post- MI, around 87.3%  The prognosis is in part dictated by the amount of myocardium affected and the ability to reperfuse the ischemic myocardium. The sooner the ischemia is treated, better chances of a good outcome there will be  There is no difference between the mortality rate of CS complicating STEMI or CS complicating NSTEMI.  The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) are good echocardiographic predictors for the mortality rate of CS.

It will become more apparent with exercise, with the patient lying on their left-hand side, or with the patient holding expiration. If the culprit is the right ventricle, the abnormal rhythm will be most evident on the lower left hand side of the sternum, and will get louder with exercise and quick, deep inspiration . The fourth heart sound S4 is sometimes audible in healthy children, but when audible in an adult is called a presystolic gallop or atrial gallop. This gallop is a sign of a pathologic state, usually a failing left ventricle. This sound occurs just after atrial contraction (\"atrial kick\") and is the sound of blood being forced into a stiff/hypertrophic left ventricle. The combined presence of S3 and S4 is a quadruple gallop. At rapid heart rates, S3 and S4 may merge to produce a summation gallop.\nIt is caused by the atria contracting forcefully in an effort to overcome an abnormally-stiff ventricle.\nThe S 4 rhythm is associated with disorders that increases the stiffness of the ventricle, including:\nLong-standing hypertension Aortic stenosis Overload of the ventricle Fibrosis of the ventricle Left ventricular hypertrophy Coronary Artery Disease Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Pulmonary Hypertension\nAgain, the rhythm itself does not require treatment; the underlying cause of ventricular stiffness or dysfunction does."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the definition of gliomatosis cerebri?", "output": "If left untreated, patients with gliomatosis cerebri may progress to develop focal neurological deficits, altered mental status, hydrocephalus, brain herniation, and ultimately death.

Step-wise training works in a similar fashion. An athlete warms up in stages of increasing intensity, using the refractory period generated by each stage to get up to a full workload.\nTherapy should be routinely monitored with the assessment of peak expiratory flow rate performed before and after the exercise. Methacholine challenge test is another alternative to objectively assess response to therapy.  \nFish oil supplementation may represent a potentially beneficial non-pharmacologic intervention for patients with exercise-induced asthma. \nThe most common medication approach is to use a beta agonist about twenty minutes before exercise. \nEquipotent doses of the bronchodilators such as salmeterol, formoterol and terbutaline have shown to be effective with respect to their short-term protective potency against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. \nTachyphylaxis developed to the protective effect of long and short-acting beta-2 agonist and hence is less effective when used for exercise-induced asthma.

This subject has been studied with fewer than 1000 patients enrolled in randomized trials. In the period between trials studying rescue PCI, there was a transition between angiographic and electrocardiographic diagnosis to detect failed reperfusion.\nImportantly, in the earlier studies, rescue PCI was performed in infarct arteries with TIMI 0/1 flow, often after a protocol-mandated 90 minute angiogram. In MERLIN and REACT, however, patients were randomized if they had less than 50% ST segment elevation resolution at 60 or 90 minutes, respectively. Many patients had patent infarct arteries on angiography; only 54% of patients in MERLIN and 74% of patients in REACT (which required less than TIMI grade 3 flow for PCI) actually underwent PCI. From a procedural standpoint, stents have replaced balloon angioplasty, antiplatelet therapy has improved with the addition of a thienopyridine agent and often a GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, and procedural success rates are higher.\nDespite these historical differences, recent data support the initial observation that rescue PCI decreases adverse clinical events compared with medical therapy. In the Wijeysundera meta-analysis , there was a trend toward reduced mortality rates with rescue PCI from 10.4% to 7.3% (RR 0.69 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.05; p=0.09), reduced reinfarction rates from 10.7% to 6.1% (RR 0.58 95% CI 0.35 to 0.97; p=0.04), and reduced heart failure rates from 17.8% to 12.7% (RR 0.73 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00; p=0.05). These event rates suggest that high-risk patients were selected for enrollment, so these data do not inform the clinical community about the role of rescue PCI in lower-risk patients. Also, the benefits of rescue PCI need to be balanced against the risk.\nThere was an excess occurrence of stroke in 2 trials (10 events vs. 2 events), but the majority of the strokes were thromboembolic rather than hemorrhagic, and the sample size was small, so more data are needed to define this risk. There also was an increase in absolute risk of bleeding of 13%, suggesting that adjustments in antithrombotic medication dosing are needed to improve safety. It should be noted that the majority of patients who underwent rescue PCI received fibrinolytic therapy with streptokinase."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "For what purpose is an MRI employed in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer?", "output": "MRI:    \nMRI is considered when there is a diagnostic difficulty even after performing a CT scan. MRI is helpful in staging the extent and spread of pancreatic carcinoma rather than for detecting tumors or lesions less than 2 cm in size. MRI also helps in avoiding the radiation exposure when compared to a CT scan. MRI scan while determining pancreatic adenocarcinoma relies on the assessment of the size, shape, contour of the gland. Gadolinium is the contrast material most commonly used in the contrast MRI scan of the pancreas. MRI is helpful in characterizing cystic lesions of the pancreas and can aid in arriving at the diagnosis. Pancreatic cancer shows hypointense lesions on gadolinium -enhanced T1-weighted images. For the complete evaluation of the pancreatic parenchyma and the pancreaticobiliary ductal system, the following magnetic resonance sequences is advised: T1-weighted gradient-echo; T2-weighted axial and coronal sequences, usually turbo spin-echo; two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) MRCP T1-weighted 3D gradient-echo (GRE) before and after intravenous administration of gadolinium. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) nowadays is being widely used.

Unlike the rest of the eye, which is derived mostly from the neural ectoderm, the lens is derived from the surface ectoderm. The first stage of lens differentiation takes place when the optic vesicle, which is formed from outpocketings in the neural ectoderm, comes in proximity to the surface ectoderm. The optic vesicle induces nearby surface ectoderm to form the lens placode. At the 4 mm stage, the lens placode is a single monolayer of columnar cells.\nAs development progresses, the lens placode begins to deepen and invaginate. As the placode continues to deepen, the opening to the surface ectoderm constricts and the lens cells forms a structure known as the lens vesicle. By the 10 mm stage, the lens vesicle has completely separated from the surface ectoderm.\nAfter the 10mm stage, signals from the developing neural retina induces the cells closest to the posterior end of the lens vesicle begin to elongate toward the anterior end of the vesicle.  These signals also induce the synthesis of crystallins.  These elongating cells eventually fill in the lumen of the vesicle to form the primary fibers, which become the embryonic nucleus in the mature lens. The cells of the anterior portion of the lens vesicle give rise to the lens epithelium.\nAdditional secondary fibers are derived from lens epithelial cells located toward the equatorial region of the lens. These cells lengthen anteriorly and posteriorly to encircle the primary fibers. The new fibers grow longer than those of the primary layer, but as the lens gets larger, the ends of the newer fibers cannot reach the posterior or anterior poles of the lens. The lens fibers that do not reach the poles form tight, interdigitating seams with neighboring fibers. These seams are readily visible and are termed sutures. The suture patterns become more complex as more layers of lens fibers are added to the outer portion of the lens.\nThe lens continues to grow after birth, with the new secondary fibers being added as outer layers. New lens fibers are generated from the equatorial cells of the lens epithelium, in a region referred to as the germinative zone. The lens epithelial cells elongate, lose contact with the capsule and epithelium, synthesize crystallin, and then finally lose their organelles as they become mature lens fibers.  From development through early adulthood, the addition of secondary lens fibers results in the lens growing more ellipsoid in shape; after about age 20, however, the lens grows rounder with time."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What does the term \"ventricular pressure\" mean?", "output": "Ventricular pressure is a measure of blood pressure within the ventricles of the heart."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the natural progression, potential complications, and expected outcomes of cervical cancer?", "output": "Cervical cancer is the most common cancer mainly among women in developing countries, there is an estimate of almost 260,000 deaths annually, about 80% occurred in developing countries.  Infection by high risk strain of oncogenic HPV types is an established cause of neoplastic lesions of the cervix, vagina and vulva, anus, penis and oropharynx. HPV 16 and 18, are the most common cause of approximately 70% of all cervical cancers worldwide. HPV is highly transmissible through direct skin to skin contact and intercourse, women with persistent high-risk HPV infection s are at greatest risk for developing cervical cancer. Since the identification of HPV as main cause of cervical cancer, prevention strategies had been developed by the introduction of HPV testing and cytology screening and utilizing HPV vaccines in preadolescent girls and young women whom are at greater risk.  The most important risk factors associated with the infection by HPV are sexual intercourse at early age at the start of the first sexual relationships, having high number of sexual partners throughout life, or women being with men having multiple sexual partners. Male circumcision and use of condoms are factors that can reduce, but not preventing the transmission of human papilloma virus.

As the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis is made, surveillance is needed to help detect and manage any complications.  A routine annual review is usually sufficient to detect any complications such as parvovirus infection or abdominal pain which may necessitate the investigation for gallstones. Folic acid Folate supplementation is not always required, but is used as a routine for children with severe hemolysis and in pregnancy, regardless of severity of hereditary spherocytosis.  Folic acid supplementation is appropriate for those with moderate to severe hemolysis and/or during pregnancy. This is based on an increased requirement for folate in RBC production; there are no clinical trials investigating the role of folic acid treatment, and observational studies that documented megaloblastic anemia in a small number of patients with hereditary spherocytosis were performed before the institution of routine folic acid supplementation of grains and cereals.  The typical dose for those with moderate to severe hemolysis is 1 to 2 mg/day, while those who have hereditary spherocytosis of any severity and are pregnant should receive doses as high as 4 to 5 mg/day, as discussed separately. For individuals with mild hemolysis who have normal intake of fresh fruits and vegetables (or folic-acid -supplemented grains), daily folic acid is not required, but for those who place a high value on avoiding folate deficiency, which could cause worsening anemia, taking daily folic acid (typical dose, 1 to 2 mg daily) is safe and inexpensive, and there are essentially no side effects or contraindications.\nTransfusions Blood transfusion is often required in severely affected infants and may be needed during certain times in other settings (eg, aplastic crisis, pregnancy).However, transfusions usually are not required on a chronic basis or for a long enough time to cause iron overload. Typical hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion depend on the age of the patient, symptoms, and comorbidities. Some infants may require transfusions for anemia and/or hyperbilirubinemia. Older children may be able to tolerate a hemoglobin level of 5 to 6 g/dL without transfusions. Adults may require transfusions for anemia, with thresholds determined by their clinical status, Individuals with an aplastic crisis due to parvovirus infection or other bone marrow insult may require transfusions if they have a decreasing hemoglobin level without a robust reticulocytosis. The usual course of parvovirus associated anemia is spontaneous resolution within a few days or weeks. Infected individuals are monitored with twice-weekly complete blood counts (CBCs) and reticulocyte counts to determine the expected hemoglobin nadir and the need for transfusion. Consideration of transfusional iron overload typically occurs after transfusion of more than 15 to 20 units of RBCs (more than 10 units in smaller children). Adults with mild hemolysis may have a slight increase in iron absorption, and if this occurs in the setting of hereditary hemochromatosis, which is common, iron overload may occur.\nErythropoietin Erythropoietin (EPO) may be helpful in reducing the need for transfusion in some infants.  Typically, this can be discontinued around the age of nine months. In one study, the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (1000 international units/kg per week) with iron supplementation obviated the need for transfusion in 13 of 16 infants with severe hereditary spherocytosis.  As the infants grew and began to mount an adequate erythropoietic response, the erythropoietin dose could be tapered and discontinued before the age of nine months.\nOther therapies Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is not used in hereditary spherocytosis due to an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio, but a case was reported in which an individual with both hereditary spherocytosis and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which cured both disorders. \nThere are no special restrictions (eg, no activity limitations) on children with splenomegaly due to hereditary spherocytosis."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Which additional diagnostic tests are used for aplastic anemia?", "output": "There are no other diagnostic studies for aplastic anemia."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the assessment instrument for respiratory distress?", "output": "The RDAI was tested for reliability by two of the original investigators.

Other problems can also cause the same symptoms such as stomach discomfort and indigestion. If you have these symptoms, you should go see your doctor at your earliest convenience. Some tests your doctor will most likely do include lab tests, image tests, and endoscopy. Among these procedures, endoscopy is the main test in the diagnosis of stomach cancer.\nEndoscopy and biopsy - It is the main test used to diagnose stomach cancer when people have certain risk factors or when signs and symptoms suggest this disease may be present. After you are sedated (made sleepy), an endoscope, which is a thin, flexible, lighted tube, is passed down your throat. Then the doctor can view the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of the small intestine. If abnormal areas are noted, a biopsy can be obtained through the endoscope. The tissue samples will be checked by the pathologists under a microscope to see whether cancer is present or not. Upper gastrointestinal series - This is an x-ray test in which a person is given an injection of a medication that will temporarily slow bowel movement so that the stomach structures can be more easily seen on the x-rays. For this test, the patient drinks 16 - 20 ounces of a millkshake-like substance called barium. An x-ray method called fluoroscopy tracks how the barium moves through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Pictures are taken in a variety of positions. The test usually takes around 3 hours or more. Complete blood test - In this test, a patient with stomach cancer can be tested to see if they also have anemia. Stool test - This test is to detect whether blood is in your digestive tract. Before the test, do not eat red meat, any blood-containing food, cantaloupe, uncooked broccoli, turnip, radish, or horseradish for 3 days. You can collect stool samples in your home. You can catch the stool on plastic wrap that is held in place by the toilet seat. Put the sample in a clean container. There can be false-positive and false-negative results. Using the right collection technique, avoiding certain drugs, and observing food restrictions can reduce errors.\nPatients with stomach cancer have many treatment options. The options are surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of methods. Surgical removal of the stomach (gastrectomy) is the only curative way. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be beneficial treatment. Recent clinical study demonstrated that chemotherapy and radiation therapy given after surgery can improve the chances of a cure, but for patients with metastatic stomach cancer, chemotherapy and/or radiation can improve symptoms and life quality but may not cure the cancer. For some patients with gastric tract obstruction, a surgical bypass procedure may provide relief of symptoms. Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities. Because cancer treatments often damage healthy cells and tissues, side effects are common. Side effects may not be the same for each person, and they may change from one treatment session to the next."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What information is currently available regarding statins?", "output": "See current NICE guidelines.\nPrimary prevention: dyslipidaemia Secondary prevention of ischaemic cardiac events Peripheral Vascular Disease\nSecondary prevention of nonfatal ischaemic events with high dose statins (atrovastatin) \nStatins in older people\nBandolier give the following statement in their document  - \"Statins are effective in older people, and just as effective as in people aged under 65 or 70 years.\".

This process can be understood in several steps, outlined below as \"chemoattraction\", \"rolling adhesion\", \"tight adhesion\" and \"(endothelial) transmigration\". It has been demonstrated that leukocyte recruitment is halted whenever any of these steps is suppressed.\nUpon recognition of and activation by pathogens, resident macrophages in the affected tissue release cytokines such as IL-1, TNF\u03b1 and chemokines. IL-1 and TNF\u03b1 cause the endothelial cells of blood vessels near the site of infection to express cellular adhesion molecules, including selectins. Circulating leukocytes are localised towards the site of injury or infection due to the presence of chemokines.\nLike velcro, selectin ligands on circulating leukocytes bind selectins on the inner wall of the vessel, with marginal affinity. This causes the leukocytes to slow down and begin rolling along the inner surface of the vessel wall. During this rolling motion, transitory bonds are formed and broken between selectins and their ligands.\nAt the same time, chemokines released by macrophages activate the rolling leukocytes and cause surface integrin molecules to switch from the default low-affinity state to a high-affinity state. This is assisted through juxtacrine activation of integrins by chemokines and soluble factors released by endothelial cells. In the activated state, integrins bind tightly to complementary receptors expressed on endothelial cells, with high affinity. This effects the immobilisation of the leukocytes, despite the shear forces of the ongoing blood flow.\nThe cytoskeletons of the leukocytes are reorganised in such a way that the leukocytes are spread out over the endothelial cells. In this form, leukocytes extend pseudopodia and pass through gaps between endothelial cells. Transmigration of the leukocyte occurs as PECAM proteins, found on the leukocyte and endothelial cell surfaces, interact and effectively pull the cell through the endothelium. The leukocytes secrete proteases that degrade the basement membrane, allowing them to escape the blood vessel \u2013 a process known as diapedesis. Once in the interstitial fluid, leukocytes migrate along a chemotactic gradient towards the site of injury or infection."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the explanation of the pathological processes underlying multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1?", "output": "The gene locus causing multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 has been localised to chromosome 11q13 by studies of loss of heterozigosity (LOH) on multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 associated tumors and by linkage analysis in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 families.      MEN1, spans about 10 Kb and consists of ten exons encoding a 610 amino acid nuclear protein, named menin.  MEN1 gene is a putative tumor suppressor gene and causes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 by Knudson's \"two hits\" model for tumor development.  Knudson's \"two hits\" model for tumor development suggest that there is a germline mutation present in all cells at birth and the second mutation is a somatic mutation that occurs in the predisposed endocrine cell and leads to loss of the remaining wild type allele. This \"two hits\" model gives cells the survival advantage needed for tumor development. Mutations are distributed over the entire coding region without showing any significant hot spot region.       Approximately 20% of mutations are nonsense mutations, about 50% are frameshift insertions and deletions, 20% are missense mutations and about 7% are splice site defects.\nMEN1 gene encodes a 610 amino acid (67 Kda) nuclear protein called menin.      The first identified partner of menin was JunD, a transcription factor belonging to the AP1 transcription complex family. Menin interacts with the N-terminus of JunD through its N-terminus and central domains. Wild type menin represses JunD -activated transcription maybe via a histone deacetylase-dependent mechanism.   Menin interacts, directly, with three members of the nuclear factor NF-kB family of transcription regulators: NF-kB1 (p50), NF-kB2 (p52) and RelA (p65).  These proteins modulate the expression of various genes and are involved in the oncogenesis of numerous organs. Menin interacts with NF-kB by its central domain and represses NF-kB -mediated transcription. Moreover, menin interferes with the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) signalling pathway at the level of Smad3. Alteration of the TGF\u03b2 signalling pathways is important in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Although menin has been identified primarily as a nuclear protein, recent studies have reported its interaction with the glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and with vimentin (components of intermediate filaments (IFs), suggesting a putative role in glial cell oncogenesis. Finally, menin interacts with the metastasis suppressor Nm23H1.  This interaction enables menin to act as an atypical GTPase and to hydrolyze GTP. The binding of menin to Nm23H1 may be relevant also to the control of genomic stability, as Nm23H1 is associated to the centrosome that is involved in the maintenance of chromosome integrity.    \nMEN 4 is caused by loss of function mutation in CDKN1B gene which is located on Chromosome 12 in humans."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What does Paramyotonia Congenita mean?", "output": "Paramyotonia congenita is considered an extremely rare disorder, though little epidemiological work has been done.

Most of the cases originate in Africa, specifically in Ghana, Togo, Uganda, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and other nearby countries. A few sporadic cases have been reported in countries in South America and Southeast Asia, including Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia.  The vast majority of clinical cases have been collected from northern Togo and Ghana, in West Africa. 156 cases from the areas alone were collected in a 2000 study; before then, only 116 cases were recorded in the literature.  O. bifurcum infection in northern Togo and Ghana is found in virtually every village, with some rural areas exhibiting prevalence of as much as 90,000 per 100,000 population. A study done by Krepel in 1992 revealed a correlation between infection with O. bifurcum and N. americanus in that individuals living in endemic villages were either coinfected with both parasites or neither. This could be due to cofactors shared by both parasites, including poor hygiene, certain agricultural practices and the dearth of potable water suitable for consumption.\nBelow is a review of some epidemiological studies on the epidemiology of Oesophagostomum bifurcum in northern Togo and Ghana:\n\"Human Oesophagostomum infection in northern Togo and Ghana: epidemiological aspects.\" By: Krepel et al. Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology.1992. 86:289-300.\nA regional survey of O. bifurcum infection was carried out in Togo and Ghana. The parasite was found in 38 of the 43 villages surveyed, with the highest prevalence rates reaching 59% in some small, isolated villages. Infection was found to be positively correlated with hookworm infection; however, the difficulty in distinguishing these parasites may have had some confounding effect. Infection rates were low in children under 3 years of age, beyond that, rates of infection increased dramatically until 10 years of age. Interestingly, females showed higher prevalence of infection (34%)than men (24%). Based on these epidemiological studies, this group was ale to conclude that tribe, profession, or religion had no effect on the prevalence of infection in the different communities surveyed.

For women who are receiving a stavudine -containing antepartum regimen, stavudine should be discontinued during labor while intravenous zidovudine is being administered (AI). Women who are receiving an antepartum combination antiretroviral (ARV) drug regimen should continue this regimen on schedule as much as possible during labor and before scheduled cesarean delivery (AIII). Women receiving fixed-dose combination regimens that include zidovudine should receive intravenous zidovudine during labor while other oral ARV components are continued (AIII). For women who have received antepartum ARV drugs but have suboptimal viral suppression near delivery (i.e., HIV RNA >1,000 copies/mL), scheduled cesarean delivery is recommended (AI). The addition of single-dose intrapartum/newborn nevirapine is not recommended (AI). Women of unknown HIV status who present in labor should undergo rapid HIV antibody testing (AII). If the results are positive, a confirmatory HIV test should be done as soon as possible and maternal/infant ARV drugs should be initiated pending results of the confirmatory test (AII). If the confirmatory HIV test is positive, infant ARV drugs should be continued for 6 weeks (AI); if the test is negative, the infant ARV drugs should be stopped. Intravenous zidovudine is recommended for HIV-infected women in labor who have not received antepartum ARV drugs and infant combination ARV prophylaxis is recommended for 6 weeks (AII). \nScheduled cesarean delivery at 38 weeks\u2019 gestation is recommended for women with HIV RNA levels >1,000 copies/mL near the time of delivery, irrespective of administration of antepartum antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, and for women with unknown HIV RNA levels near the time of delivery (AII). Scheduled cesarean delivery is not routinely recommended for prevention of perinatal transmission in pregnant women receiving combination ARV drugs with plasma HIV RNA levels <1,000 copies/mL near the time of delivery. Data are insufficient to evaluate the potential benefit of cesarean delivery in this group, and given the low rate of transmission in these patients, it is unclear whether scheduled cesarean delivery would confer additional benefit in reducing transmission. This decision should be individualized based on discussion between the obstetrician and the mother (BII). It is not clear whether cesarean delivery after rupture of membranes or onset of labor provides benefit in preventing perinatal transmission. Management of women originally scheduled for cesarean delivery who present with ruptured membranes or in labor must be individualized based on duration of rupture, progress of labor, plasma HIV RNA level, current ARV regimen, and other clinical factors (BII). Women should be informed of the risks associated with cesarean delivery; the risks to the woman should be balanced with potential benefits expected for the neonate (AIII). \nGenerally avoid artificial rupture of membranes unless there are clear obstetric indications because of a potential increased risk of transmission (BIII). Routine use of fetal scalp electrodes for fetal monitoring should be avoided in the setting of maternal HIV infection unless there are clear obstetric indications (BIII). Operative delivery with forceps or a vacuum extractor and/or episiotomy should be performed only if there are clear obstetric indications (BIII). The antiretroviral drug (ARV) regimen a woman is receiving should be taken into consideration when treating excessive postpartum bleeding resulting from uterine atony: In women who are receiving a cytochrome P (CYP) 3A4 enzyme inhibitor such as a protease inhibitor (PI), methergine should only be used if no alternative treatments for postpartum hemorrhage are available and the need for pharmacologic treatment outweighs the risks. If methergine is used, it should be administered in the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration (BIII). In women who are receiving a CYP3A4 enzyme inducer such as nevirapine or efavirenz, additional uterotonic agents may be needed because of the potential for decreased methergine levels and inadequate treatment effect (BIII)."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Can you provide an explanation and overview of Phlegmon?", "output": "Phlegmon is a spreading diffuse inflammatory process with formation of suppurative/purulent exudate or pus."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is vaginismus and can you give a brief explanation of what it is?", "output": "Vaginismus (the German equivalent of the word Vaginism) is a condition which affects a woman's ability to engage in any form of vaginal penetration, including sexual penetration, insertion of tampons, and the penetration involved in gynecological examinations. This is the result of a conditioned reflex of the pubococcygeus muscle, which is sometimes referred to as the'PC muscle'. The reflex causes the muscles in the vagina to tense suddenly, which makes any kind of vaginal penetration -- including sexual penetration -- either painful or impossible.\nA vaginismic woman does not consciously control the spasm. The vaginismic reflex can be compared to the response of the eye shutting when an object comes towards it. The severity of vaginismus varies from woman to woman."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the epidemiology and demographics of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura?", "output": "Epidemiology and demgraphics of HSP:  \nThe incidence of HSP is approximately 6-20 cases per 100,000 individuals.\nThe prevalence of HSP is more in children of 4-6 years age group.\nHSP usually affects Caucasians than any other ethnic groups.\nMales are more commonly affected by HSP than females.

Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors. It should be noted that NSAIDs compete with aspirin to bind to this serine residue, and this is the mechanism by which a prior dose of a NSAID inhibits the efficacy of aspirin. While inhibition of thromboxane inhibits platelet aggregation, inhibition of prostaglandins may increase the risk of vasoconstriction. Given the potential for vasoconstriction with increasing doses, higher doses of aspirin (325 mg and greater) may not be more effective than doses of 162 to 75 mg.\nThere are at least two different types of cyclooxygenase (COX): COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. Normally COX-2 produces prostanoids, most of which are pro-inflammatory. Aspirin-modified COX-2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs called COX-2 selective inhibitors have been developed that inhibit only COX-2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side-effects.\nHowever, several of the new COX-2 selective inhibitors, such as Vioxx, have been withdrawn recently, after evidence emerged that COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack. It is proposed that endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body express COX-2, and, by selectively inhibiting COX-2, prostaglandins (specifically PGI2; prostacyclin) are down-regulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as COX-1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anti-coagulative effect of PGI2 is decreased, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new COX once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors. Utilization of NSAIDs is contraindicated in STEMI, and NSAIDs therapy should be withdrawn in patients with STEMI because of a heightened risk of recurrent MI and congestive heart failure."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the underlying mechanism that causes chronic diarrhea?", "output": "Diarrhea is a condition of altered intestinal water and electrolyte transport. The physiological mechanisms of diarrhea include osmotic, secretory, inflammatory, altered motility, and iatrogenic mechanisms. \nOsmotic chronic diarrhea involves an unabsorbed substance that draws water from the plasma into the intestinal lumen along osmotic gradients. If excessive amounts of unabsorbed substance are retained in the intestinal lumen, water will not be absorbed and diarrhea will result.\nChronic diarrhea due to an osmotic cause includes osmotic laxatives such as lactose intolerance antacids, fructose, lactulose, laxatives magnesium, phosphate, and sorbitol.  Maldigestion syndromes such as disaccharidase deficiency and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can also result in osmotic chronic diarrhea. Osmotic diarrheas might result in steatorrhea and azotorrhea (passage of fat and nitrogenous substances into the stool), but they typically do not cause any rectal bleeding. \nSecretory chronic diarrhea results from disordered electrolyte transport and, despite the term, is more commonly caused by decreased absorption rather than net secretion.\nSecretory diarrheas include congenital abnormalities such as congenital chloridorrhea, in which an abnormality in the genetic control of chloride-bicarbonate exchange in the ileum results in the loss of chloride into the stool. Another example is the loss of \u03b12-adrenergic function in enterocytes of patients with autonomic neuropathy caused by diabetes mellitus. The typical features of secretory diarrhea include the persistence of the diarrhea with fasting and the absence of steatorrhea, azotorrhea, or blood per rectum. Secretory diarrheas caused by neuroendocrine tumors have been identified by measurement of plasma levels of the hormone or its metabolite in the urine. Investigations include measurements of VIP, gastrin, or calcitonin in plasma or 24-hour collections of urine for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. \nDisruption of the normal colonic epithelial barrier by microorganisms is mainly responsible for inflammatory chronic diarrhea. This disruption can lead to exudative, secretory, or malabsorptive components of inflammatory chronic diarrhea.\nInflammatory causes of chronic diarrhea might present with features that suggest malabsorption or rectal bleeding. The nature of the malabsorption depends on the regions affected (e.g., proximal vs. distal small bowel), and rectal bleeding is usually a manifestation of colonic or rectal ulcerations. Anti-inflammatory agents, including bismuth subsalicylate or other, more potent anti-inflammatory medications, appear to benefit patients with microscopic or collagenous colitis. \nBoth rapid transit time and slow transit time are associated with motility disorders causing chronic diarrhea.\nRapid transit time delivers fluid secreted during digestion to the distal small bowel or colon. This prevents reabsorption of normally secreted fluid in the small bowel, overwhelming the re-absorptive capacity of the colon. Slow transit time results in bacterial overgrowth with bile acid deconjugation, poor micelle formation, and steatorrhea. The clinical manifestations of chronic diarrhea caused by motility disorders include steatorrhea, usually up to 14 g per day. Osmotic laxatives result in acceleration of transit through the bowel, which is associated with up to 14 g of fat in the stool. Presence of more than 14 g per day of fat in the stool suggests the presence of bacterial overgrowth or associated disease such as celiac disease. \nAfter abdominal surgeries such as cholecystectomy, about 5%\u201310% of patients develop chronic diarrhea.\nMost of these cases resolve completely or significantly improve within a couple of months. Iatrogenic diarrhea is related to excessive bile acids being delivered into the intestine.   After a cholecystectomy, bile is delivered directly into the small bowel, overcoming the terminal ileum's ability to reabsorb adequately, leading to cholerheic diarrhea. Some other iatrogenic causes of chronic diarrhea might result from vagal injury and ileal resection."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you please give an explanation of what Diverticulosis is and provide some information?", "output": "Eat a high-fiber diet to help prevent problems.

The range and occurrence of adverse effects are similar for all of the proton pump inhibitors, though they have been reported more frequently with omeprazole. This may be due to its longer availability and hence clinical experience.\nCommon adverse effects include: headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, dizziness. \nInfrequent adverse effects include: rash, itch, flatulence, constipation. Decreased cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) absorption may occur with long-term use.  Rarely PPI cause \u2018idiosyncratic\u2019 reactions such as erythema multiforme, pancreatitis, Stevens Johnson syndrome and acute interstitial nephritis. \nIt has been observed that gastric acid suppression, using H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, is associated with an increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia. It is suspected that acid suppression results in insufficient elimination of pathogenic organisms. It has therefore been suggested that patients at higher risk of pneumonia should only be prescribed proton pump inhibitors at lower doses and only when necessary. \nPPIs have also been shown to raise risk of C. dif infection. \nLong-term use of proton pump inhibitors has been less studied. But in a study of 135,000 people 50 or older, those taking high doses of PPIs for longer than one year have been found to be 2.6 times more likely to break a hip. Those taking smaller doses for 1 to 4 years were 1.2 to 1.6 times more likely to break a hip. The risk of a fracture increased with the length of time taking PPIs.  Theories as to the cause of the increase are the possibility that the reduction of stomach acid reduces the amount of calcium dissolved in the stomach or that PPIs may interfere with the breakdown and rebuilding of bone by interfering with the acid production of osteoclasts."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Could you provide me with the context of the sentence, please?", "output": "Descemet's membrane is the basement membrane that lies between the corneal proper substance, also called stroma, and the endothelial layer of the cornea.

Likewise, Spanish la bomba has two different b sounds to foreign ears, Template:IPA, though a Spaniard might not be able to hear it. Omitting such detail does not make any difference to the identity of the word. /Slashes/ indicate phonemes. That is, changing symbol between slashes would make a difference in the meaning of the word, or produce nonsense.

The stimulation can come from receptive intercourse, fingering, fisting, or penetration with a dildo.\nOrgasms of this kind can cause male orgasm and ejaculation. Women do not have prostate glands, therefore can not have a prostatic orgasm. With sufficient stimulation, the prostatic structure can also be \"milked.\" Providing that there is no simultaneous stimulation of the penis prostate milking can cause ejaculation without orgasm. When combined with penile stimulation, some men report that prostate stimulation increases the volume of their ejaculation. The prostatic structure produces a secretion that forms one of the components of ejaculate; in males sperm are transmitted up the vas deferens from the testicles, into the prostate gland as well as through the seminal vesicles to produce what we know as semen. Semen is expelled through the base of the penis out by contractions from the sphinctre and prostate, thus causing an orgasm.\nProstatic orgasms can be very pleasurable.

Among its homeostatic functions are acid-base balance, regulation of electrolyte concentrations, control of blood volume, and regulation of blood pressure. The kidneys accomplish these homeostatic functions independently and through coordination with other organs, particularly those of the endocrine system. The kidney communicates with these organs through hormones secreted into the bloodstream.\nThe kidneys regulate the pH, by eliminating H + ions concentration called augmentation mineral ion concentration, and water composition of the blood.\nBy exchanging hydronium ions and hydroxyl ions, the blood plasma is maintained by the kidney at a slightly alkaline pH of 7.4. Urine, on the other hand, is acidic at pH 5 or alkaline at pH 8.\nThe pH is maintained through four main protein transporters: NHE3 (a sodium-hydrogen exchanger), V-type H-ATPase (an isoform of the hydrogen ATPase), NBC1 (a sodium- bicarbonate cotransporter) and AE1 (an anion exchanger which exchanges chloride for bicarbonate). Due to the polar alignment of cells in the renal epithelia NHE3 and the H-ATPase are exposed to the lumen (which is essentially outside the body), on the apical side of the cells, and are responsible for excreting hydrogen ions (or protons). Conversely, NBC1 and AE1 are on the basolateral side of the cells, and allow bicarbonate ions to move back into the extracellular fluid and thus are returned to the blood plasma.\nSodium ions are controlled in a homeostatic process involving aldosterone which increases sodium ion reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules.\nWhen blood pressure becomes low, a proteolytic enzyme called Renin is secreted by cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (part of the distal convoluted tubule) which are sensitive to pressure. Renin acts on a blood protein, angiotensinogen, converting it to angiotensin I (10 amino acids). Angiotensin I is then converted by the Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lung capillaries to Angiotensin II (8 amino acids), which stimulates the secretion of Aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, which then affects the renal tubules.\nAldosterone stimulates an increase in the reabsorption of sodium ions from the kidney tubules which causes an increase in the volume of water that is reabsorbed from the tubule. This increase in water reabsorption increases the volume of blood which ultimately raises the blood pressure.\nAny significant rise or drop in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland. A rise in osmolality causes the gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone, resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.\nThe kidneys secrete a variety of hormones, including erythropoietin, urodilatin, renin and vitamin D."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the effect of Adiposogenital dystrophy?", "output": "The most common cause of adiposogenital dystrophy are tumors affecting the hypothalamus or pituitary.

The pineal gland is responsible for the secretion of melatonin hormone that regulates the in the circadian cycle sleep and wakefulness. The blood supply of the pineal gland is derived from the posterior cerebral artery from its choroidal branches. The internal cerebral vein drains the blood from the epiphysis cerebri. Histologically the gland consists of cells called pinealocytes. Several different tumors can arise from the pineal gland. Primary pineal cell tumors include pineocytoma, pineoblastoma, and mixed pineal tumors. Tumors that may occur in this region but are not necessarily pineal tumors include germinoma, non-germinoma (eg, teratoma, endodermal sinus tumor, embryonal cell tumor, choriocarcinoma, and mixed tumors), meningioma, astrocytoma, ganglioglioma, and dermoid cysts. Diagnosis of the type of tumor is crucial for treatment. The primary symptom of the tumor would be hydrocephalus. If the pineal gland invades the thalamus, it can cause weakness and loss of sensation in half of the body. Invasion of the hypothalamus would disrupt sleep, impede temperature and water regulation, and cause weight gain. An MRI is important when trying to see the location and size of the tumor. A biopsy is required to determine the type of tumor. Usually, a biopsy is done via a stereotactic or endoscopic procedure.

About 10% of people have this type of bacteria in the back of their nose and throat with no signs or symptoms of disease; this is the carrier state. But sometimes Neisseria meningitidis bacteria can invade the body causing certain illnesses, which are known as meningococcal disease. Neisseria meningitidis bacteria are spread through the exchange of respiratory and throat secretions. The bacteria are not spread by casual contact or by simply breathing the air where a person with meningococcal disease has been. Sometimes Neisseria meningitidis bacteria spread to people who have had close or lengthy contact with a patient with meningococcal disease. People in the same household, roommates, or anyone with direct contact with a patient's oral secretions, such as saliva, would be considered at increased risk of getting the infection. The bacteria attach to and multiply on the mucosal cells of the nasopharynx. Adhesive factors like pilli helps to get it attached itself to nonciliated epithelial cells.\nIgA protease, factors that inhibit ciliary activity and polysaccharide capsule enable it to avoid host defence mechanisms. Newborn, individuals deficient in terminal components of complement pathway and properdin deficiency have recurrent infections. Mutations in mannose binding lecithin gene have increased risk of infections\nShock is due to lipooligosaccharide which is a potent toxin. This toxin initiates release of inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen radicals, prostaglandins, arachidonic acid, complement activated products, platelet aggregating factor, and perhaps nitric oxide. In a small proportion (less than 1%) of colonized persons, the organism penetrates the mucosal cells and enters the bloodstream. The bacteria spread by way of the blood to many organs. In about 50% of bacteremic persons, the organism crosses the blood \u2013 brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid and causes purulent meningitis. An antecedent upper respiratory infection may be a contributing factor. The meningococci after getting attached, gets endocytosed by parasite directed endocytosis across epithelium. The alteration in the gene expression induce a specific structural change which causes endocytosis. Meningococci once it enters the circulation survives and multiplies in it causing systemic circulation.\nMajor damage is induced by host immune mechanisms. N. meningitidis has blebs of endotoxin rich vesicles which are released into the blood stream which activitates host immune response. Endotoxin binding protein binds and alters the conformation of endotoxin enabling it to bind it to macrophages. CD14 in the endothelial cells act as receptors for endotoxin and activates macrophages which trigers an intense inflammatory response through the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF and interferon gamma. The more number of cytokines involved greater the severity of the disease. Endotoxin and the complements activate the neutrophils which release inflammatory proteins through respiratory burst and degrade the tissue.\nThe inflammatory process induced by meningococcal pathogen alters vascular permeability. Proteinuria, hypovolemia and nephrotic syndrome are results of this event. Pulmonary edema and respiratory failure are consequence of increased vascular permeability.\nDue to hypovolemia, intense compensatory vasoconstriction occurs which manifest as cold, pale, ischemic limbs. Sevre patholgical vasoconstriction causes thromobosis within the microvasculature and gangrene. Some patients develop vasodilation after resuscitation, yet maintain severe hypotension, acidosis and organ impairment known as warm shock.\nMost severe complication of meningococcemia is widespread purpura fulminans, thrombosis and hemorrhagic necrosis in large areas of the skin and infraction of limbs resulting in gangrene. Procoagulation pathways are upregulated in sepsis causing intravascular generation of thrombin.\nAcute myocardial failure may manifest as hypotension, tachycardia and shock. Pro inflammatory mediators can have a negative ionotropic effect depressing the myocardial function. Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta and nitric oxide have a negative ionotropic effect. Electrolyte imbalance also plays a vital role in cardiac dysfunction.\nThe above pictures shows the hands and feet affected by gangrene in meningococcemia.\nImpaired renal perfusion causes elevated urea and creatinine levels. Vasomotor nephropathy and acute tubularr necrosis occurs in severe cases.\nNeutrophil adhesion, coagulation activation and platelet activation causes microvacular obstruction resulting in pulmonary function impairment. It may manifest as tachypnea in early stages. Pulmonary edema and respiratory failure are the late complications of the sepsis.\nImpaired blood flow causes dysfunction of gastrointestinal tract. Prolonged ileus can cuase ischemic ulceration and perforation.\nDirect invasion of meninges by bacteria causes meningitis. Organ underperfusion causes signs and symptoms of shock. Raised intracranial tension may cause cerebral hernation. Direct bacterial activity, indirect inflammatory mediator activity and cerebral edema causes neurological damage.\nThe toll like receptor system (TLR) protects the body from invasive pathogens and also causes destruction of host in fulminent infections. The cell wall of Neisseria meningitidis has molecules that activate the TLR system in a dose dependent manner. This causes the release inflammatory mediators which can cause organ dysfunction and meningococcemia. The lipopolysacchrides in the outer membrane is another factor that illicits immune response. Peptidoglycan, bacterial lipoprotein and genetic polymorphism are factors that help contribute to broaden the inflammatory response. There is a close association between the load of meningococci, (alive or dead in CSF), plasma and magnitude of inflammatory response to the patient.\nNeisseria secretes IgA1 protease which splits IgA1 at the hinge region. \nMeningococci after entering the systemic circulaion get seeded to different parts of the body mainly meninges and skin. Sites like eyes, joints, pericardiucan also be seeded by the organism. When the breeding bacteria reaches a threshold it produces systemic symptoms like musche ache, fever and malaise. The TLR4 and TLR2 from the preoptic area of anterior hypothalamus are expressed which produces the fever causing cytokines like interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. They activate the cycloxygenase system which produces prostaglandin E2 and activates the hypothalamic prostaglandin E2 and the hypothalamic thermoregulation center raises the body temperature, increases muscle work and alter skin perfusion.\nMeningococcal lipopolysachride in plasma Meningococcal lipopolysacchride in CSF. Meningococcal DNA copies.\nPatients who were diagnosed to have massive disseminated intravascular coagulation or disseminated septic shock had almost 1000 fold higher amount of LPS in plasma and CSF and copies of DNA of meningococcus than those with only meningitis with the same incubation period.\nMeningococcal meningitis presents as headache, fever, nuchal rigidity. Kernig sign will be present. A hemorrhagic skin rash is usually found which is less than 10 mm in diameter. As the organism grows in the blood stream, it transverse blood brain barrier and invade subarachnoid space. There they multiply and produce the signs and symptoms of meningitis. Approximately 50 % of the patients will have a positive blood cultures.\nThe endothelial cells and Kupffer cells forms a complex receptor system that helps to remove the whole bacteria, lipopolysacchrides (LPS) and DNA molecules."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the history and what are the symptoms of Strongyloidiasis?", "output": "The significant information that needs to be focused on in the history of the patient includes:\nHistory of travel to the endemic areas History of exposure to individuals with similar complaints"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What does Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency mean?", "output": "Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood.

Familial adenomatous polyposis must be confirmed by a sigmoidoscopy or a full colonoscopy depending on the age of the patient.\nThe majority of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis are asymptomatic till colorectal cancer happens. Common symptoms of familial adenomatous polyposis are gastrointestinal bleeding, pain, and altered bowel habits. They might have fatigue following occult bleeding.\nPatients with familial adenomatous polyposis usually appear normal. Physical examination of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis may have palpable abdominal mass, multiple small rectal polyps, and pallor.\nLaboratory findings that may present with familial adenomatous polyposis include anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding and abnormal liver function tests due to colon cancer metastasis.\nThere are no ECG findings associated with familial adenomatous polyposis.\nDouble-contrast Barium enema may be helpful in the diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. Familial adenomatous polyposis might be presented as multiple outgrowths with lobulation or indentation and filling defects on x-rays.\nThere are no echocardiography or ultrasound findings associated with familial adenomatous polyposis.\nCT scan with contrast and CT colonography or virtual colonoscopy may be helpful in the diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. Multiple outgrowths and filling defects are suggestive of familial adenomatous polyposis.\nMRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and MRI colonography are used to detect polyps.\nColonoscopic spectroscopy and narrow-band imaging (NBI) may be helpful in the diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis.\nColonoscopy is considered as a gold standard for evaluating intestine, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Tissue biopsy and polypectomy could be done during colonoscopy. Findings on a colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy suggestive of familial adenomatous polyposis include visual detection of multiple colon polyps.
