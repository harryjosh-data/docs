Specifically, it cleaves the interaction between the hemagglutinin (HA) protein on the surface of the virus and sialic acid on the surface of host cells. This allows the virus to detach from infected cells and spread to other cells in the body. Neuraminidase is found in a number of different viruses, including influenza A and B viruses, and is a target for antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). By inhibiting neuraminidase, these drugs can help to reduce the severity and duration of influenza infections."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What is the role of neuraminidase in the life cycle of viruses, and how does it contribute to the release of mature virions?", "output": "Neuraminidase is a viral envelope protein that plays a crucial role in the life cycle of many viruses. Specifically, it is involved in the release of mature virions from infected cells. Neuraminidase cleaves the sialic acid residues on the surface of host cells, which allows the virus to detach from the cell membrane and be released into the surrounding environment. This process is essential for the spread of viral infections and is particularly important in the case of influenza viruses. Inhibiting neuraminidase activity can therefore be an effective strategy for treating viral infections and reducing their spread."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are neural tube defects, and when do they typically arise during pregnancy?", "output": "Neural tube defects are a group of congenital birth defects that affect the development of the brain and spinal cord.
