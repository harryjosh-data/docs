For example:\nAllergens that are breathed in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus production, cough, or wheezing. Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes. Eating something you are allergic to can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, or a severe, life-threatening reaction. Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash, hives, itching, blisters, or even skin peeling.

It also reacts to foreign substances called allergens, which are generally harmless and in most people do not cause a problem.But in a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, it releases chemicals such as histamines. which fight off the allergen. This causes itching, swelling, mucus production, muscle spasms, hives, rashes, and other symptoms, which vary from person to person.\nCommon allergens include pollen, mold, pet dander, and dust. Food and drug allergies are common. Allergic reactions can also be caused by insect bites, jewelry, cosmetics, spices, and other substances.Some people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers.\nSometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms.A specific allergy is not usually passed down through families (inherited). However, if both your parents have allergies, you are likely to have allergies. The chance is greater if your mother has allergies.\nAllergies may make certain medical conditions such as sinus problems, eczema, and asthma worse.Allergies are relatively common.

This reaction happens quickly after the exposure, is severe, and involves the whole body.\nTissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms.\nSome drugs (morphine, x-ray dye, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. Aspirin may also cause a reaction. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with \"true\" anaphylaxis. However, the symptoms, risk for complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions.\nAnaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen.

Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.\nA true drug allergy results from a series of chemical steps within the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.\nIt can develop two different ways:\nThe first time you take the medicine, you have no problems, but your body's immune system produces a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE, but this is not well understood.\nMost drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after exposure to a medication or vaccine.\nPenicillin and related antibiotics are the most common cause of drug allergies. Other common allergy-causing drugs include:\nSulfa drugs. Anticonvulsants. Insulin preparations (particularly animal sources of insulin). Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like anaphylactoid reactions).\nMost side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered \"idiosyncratic.\" This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication, not due to a predictable chemical effect of the drug.

In a true food allergy, the immune system produces antibodies and histamine in response to the specific food.\nAny food can cause an allergic reaction, but a few foods are the main culprits. In children, the most common food allergies are to:\nEggs. Milk. Peanuts. Shellfish (shrimp, crab, lobster). Soy. Tree nuts. Wheat.\nA food allergy frequently starts in childhood, but it can begin at any age. Fortunately, many children will outgrow their allergy to milk, egg, wheat, and soy by the time they are 5 years old if they avoid the offending foods when they are young. Allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish tend to be lifelong.\nIn older children and adults, the most common food allergies are:\nFish. Peanuts. Shellfish. Tree nuts.\nFood additives -- such as dyes, thickeners, and preservatives \u2013 may rarely cause an allergic or intolerance reaction.\nAn allergy syndrome that affects the mouth and tongue may occur after eating certain fresh fruits and vegetables.

Among the more common are:\nSkin tests. Elimination-type tests. Blood tests (including the radioallergosorbent, or RAST, test).\nSKIN TESTS\nSkin tests are the most common. Specific methods vary.\nOne of the most common methods is the prick test. This test involves placing a small amount of suspectedallergy-causing substances on the skin, usually the forearm, upper arm, or the back. Then, the skin is pricked so the allergen goes under the skin's surface. The health care provider closely watches the skin for signs of a reaction, usually swelling and redness of the site. Results are usually seen within 15-20 minutes. Several allergens can be tested at the same time.\nA similar method involves injecting a small amount of allergen into the skin and watching for a reaction at the site. This is called an intradermal skin test. It is more likely to be used when testing is being done to find out if you are allergy to something specific, such as bee venom or penicillin.\nPatch testing is a method to diagnose allergic reactions on the skin. Possible allergens are taped to the skin for 48 hours. The health care provider will look at the area in 24 hours, and then again 48 hours later.\nSkin tests are most useful for diagnosing:\nFood allergy. Mold, pollen, animal, and other allergies that cause allergic rhinitis and asthma. Penicillin allergy. Venom allergy. Allergic contact dermatitis.\nELIMINATION TESTS\nAn elimination diet can be used to check for food allergies. An elimination diet is one in which foods that may be causing symptoms are removed from the diet for several weeks and then slowly re-introduced one at a time while the person is watched for signs of an allergic reaction.\nBLOOD TESTS\nBlood tests can be done to measure the amount of immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies to a specific allergen in the blood. This test may be used when skin testing is not helpful or cannot be done\nOther blood tests include:\nAbsolute eosinophil count. Total IgE level.\nPROVOCATION\nProvocation (challenge) testing involves exposing a person to a suspected allergen under controlled circumstances. This may be done in the diet or by breathing in the suspected allergen. This type of test may provoke severe allergic reactions. Challenge testing should only be done by a doctor.\nAnother method is the double-blind test. This method involves giving foods and harmless substances in a disguised form. The person being tested and the provider are both unaware of whether the substance tested in that session is the harmless substance or the suspected food. A third party knows the identity of the substances and identifies them with some sort of code. This test requires several sessions if more than one substance is under investigation.\nWhile the double-blind strategy is useful and practical for mild allergic reactions, it must be done carefully in individuals with suspected severe reactions to foods. Blood tests may be a safer first approach.\nSkin tests may cause very mild discomfort when the skin is pricked. Itching may occur if you have a positive reaction to the allergen."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who needs Skin allergy testing?", "output": "Allergy tests are done to determine the specific substances that cause an allergic reaction in a person.\nYour doctor may order allergy tests if you have:\nAllergic rhinitis and asthma symptoms that are not easily controlled with medications.

Patients and their physicians have a number of options for the treatment of pain; some are more effective than others. Sometimes, relaxation and the use of imagery as a distraction provide relief. These methods can be powerful and effective, according to those who advocate their use. Whatever the treatment regime, it is important to remember that pain is treatable. The following treatments are among the most common.\nAcetaminophen is the basic ingredient found in Tylenol\u00ae and its many generic equivalents. It is sold over the counter, in a prescription-strength preparation, and in combination with codeine (also by prescription).\nAcupuncture dates back 2,500 years and involves the application of needles to precise points on the body. It is part of a general category of healing called traditional Chinese or Oriental medicine. Acupuncture remains controversial but is quite popular and may one day prove to be useful for a variety of conditions as it continues to be explored by practitioners, patients, and investigators.\nAnalgesic refers to the class of drugs that includes most painkillers, such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. The word analgesic is derived from ancient Greek and means to reduce or stop pain. Nonprescription or over-the-counter pain relievers are generally used for mild to moderate pain. Prescription pain relievers, sold through a pharmacy under the direction of a physician, are used for more moderate to severe pain.\nAnticonvulsants are used for the treatment of seizure disorders but are also sometimes prescribed for the treatment of pain. Carbamazepine in particular is used to treat a number of painful conditions, including trigeminal neuralgia. Another antiepileptic drug, gabapentin, is being studied for its pain-relieving properties, especially as a treatment for neuropathic pain.\nAntidepressants are sometimes used for the treatment of pain and, along with neuroleptics and lithium, belong to a category of drugs called psychotropic drugs. In addition, anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines also act as muscle relaxants and are sometimes used as pain relievers. Physicians usually try to treat the condition with analgesics before prescribing these drugs.\nAntimigraine drugs include the triptans- sumatriptan (Imitrex\u00ae), naratriptan (Amerge\u00ae), and zolmitriptan (Zomig\u00ae)-and are used specifically for migraine headaches. They can have serious side effects in some people and therefore, as with all prescription medicines, should be used only under a doctor's care.\nAspirin may be the most widely used pain-relief agent and has been sold over the counter since 1905 as a treatment for fever, headache, and muscle soreness.\nBiofeedback is used for the treatment of many common pain problems, most notably headache and back pain. Using a special electronic machine, the patient is trained to become aware of, to follow, and to gain control over certain bodily functions, including muscle tension, heart rate, and skin temperature. The individual can then learn to effect a change in his or her responses to pain, for example, by using relaxation techniques. Biofeedback is often used in combination with other treatment methods, generally without side effects. Similarly, the use of relaxation techniques in the treatment of pain can increase the patient's feeling of well-being.\nCapsaicin is a chemical found in chili peppers that is also a primary ingredient in pain-relieving creams (see Chili Peppers, Capsaicin, and Pain in the Appendix).\nChemonucleolysis is a treatment in which an enzyme, chymopapain, is injected directly into a herniated lumbar disc (see Spine Basics in the Appendix) in an effort to dissolve material around the disc, thus reducing pressure and pain. The procedure's use is extremely limited, in part because some patients may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to chymopapain.\nChiropractic care may ease back pain, neck pain, headaches, and musculoskeletal conditions. It involves \"hands-on\" therapy designed to adjust the relationship between the body's structure (mainly the spine) and its functioning. Chiropractic spinal manipulation includes the adjustment and manipulation of the joints and adjacent tissues. Such care may also involve therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises.\nCognitive-behavioral therapy involves a wide variety of coping skills and relaxation methods to help prepare for and cope with pain. It is used for postoperative pain, cancer pain, and the pain of childbirth.\nCounseling can give a patient suffering from pain much needed support, whether it is derived from family, group, or individual counseling. Support groups can provide an important adjunct to drug or surgical treatment. Psychological treatment can also help patients learn about the physiological changes produced by pain.\nCOX-2 inhibitors may be effective for individuals with arthritis. For many years scientists have wanted to develop a drug that works as well as morphine but without its negative side effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by blocking two enzymes, cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, both of which promote production of hormones called prostaglandins, which in turn cause inflammation, fever, and pain. The newer COX-2 inhibitors primarily block cyclooxygenase-2 and are less likely to have the gastrointestinal side effects sometimes produced by NSAIDs.\nIn 1999, the Food and Drug Administration approved a COX-2 inhibitor-celecoxib-for use in cases of chronic pain. The long-term effects of all COX-2 inhibitors are still being evaluated, especially in light of new information suggesting that these drugs may increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Patients taking any of the COX-2 inhibitors should review their drug treatment with their doctors.\nElectrical stimulation, including transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS), implanted electric nerve stimulation, and deep brain or spinal cord stimulation, is the modern-day extension of age-old practices in which the nerves of muscles are subjected to a variety of stimuli, including heat or massage. Electrical stimulation, no matter what form, involves a major surgical procedure and is not for everyone, nor is it 100 percent effective. The following techniques each require specialized equipment and personnel trained in the specific procedure being used:\nTENS uses tiny electrical pulses, delivered through the skin to nerve fibers, to cause changes in muscles, such as numbness or contractions. This in turn produces temporary pain relief. There is also evidence that TENS can activate subsets of peripheral nerve fibers that can block pain transmission at the spinal cord level, in much the same way that shaking your hand can reduce pain. Peripheral nerve stimulation uses electrodes placed surgically on a carefully selected area of the body. The patient is then able to deliver an electrical current as needed to the affected area, using an antenna and transmitter. Spinal cord stimulation uses electrodes surgically inserted within the epidural space of the spinal cord. The patient is able to deliver a pulse of electricity to the spinal cord using a small box-like receiver and an antenna taped to the skin. Deep brain or intracerebral stimulation is considered an extreme treatment and involves surgical stimulation of the brain, usually the thalamus. It is used for a limited number of conditions, including severe pain, central pain syndrome, cancer pain, phantom limb pain, and other neuropathic pains.\nExercise has come to be a prescribed part of some doctors' treatment regimes for patients with pain. Because there is a known link between many types of chronic pain and tense, weak muscles, exercise-even light to moderate exercise such as walking or swimming-can contribute to an overall sense of well-being by improving blood and oxygen flow to muscles. Just as we know that stress contributes to pain, we also know that exercise, sleep, and relaxation can all help reduce stress, thereby helping to alleviate pain. Exercise has been proven to help many people with low back pain. It is important, however, that patients carefully follow the routine laid out by their physicians.\nHypnosis, first approved for medical use by the American Medical Association in 1958, continues to grow in popularity, especially as an adjunct to pain medication. In general, hypnosis is used to control physical function or response, that is, the amount of pain an individual can withstand. How hypnosis works is not fully understood. Some believe that hypnosis delivers the patient into a trance-like state, while others feel that the individual is simply better able to concentrate and relax or is more responsive to suggestion. Hypnosis may result in relief of pain by acting on chemicals in the nervous system, slowing impulses. Whether and how hypnosis works involves greater insight-and research-into the mechanisms underlying human consciousness.\nIbuprofen is a member of the aspirin family of analgesics, the so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see below). It is sold over the counter and also comes in prescription-strength preparations.\nLow-power lasers have been used occasionally by some physical therapists as a treatment for pain, but like many other treatments, this method is not without controversy.\nMagnets are increasingly popular with athletes who swear by their effectiveness for the control of sports-related pain and other painful conditions. Usually worn as a collar or wristwatch, the use of magnets as a treatment dates back to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. While it is often dismissed as quackery and pseudoscience by skeptics, proponents offer the theory that magnets may effect changes in cells or body chemistry, thus producing pain relief.\nNarcotics (see Opioids, below).\nNerve blocks employ the use of drugs, chemical agents, or surgical techniques to interrupt the relay of pain messages between specific areas of the body and the brain. There are many different names for the procedure, depending on the technique or agent used. Types of surgical nerve blocks include neurectomy; spinal dorsal, cranial, and trigeminal rhizotomy; and sympathectomy, also called sympathetic blockade (see Nerve Blocks in the Appendix).\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including aspirin and ibuprofen) are widely prescribed and sometimes called non-narcotic or non-opioid analgesics. They work by reducing inflammatory responses in tissues. Many of these drugs irritate the stomach and for that reason are usually taken with food. Although acetaminophen may have some anti-inflammatory effects, it is generally distinguished from the traditional NSAIDs.\nOpioids are derived from the poppy plant and are among the oldest drugs known to humankind. They include codeine and perhaps the most well-known narcotic of all, morphine. Morphine can be administered in a variety of forms, including a pump for patient self-administration. Opioids have a narcotic effect, that is, they induce sedation as well as pain relief, and some patients may become physically dependent upon them. For these reasons, patients given opioids should be monitored carefully; in some cases stimulants may be prescribed to counteract the sedative side effects. In addition to drowsiness, other common side effects include constipation, nausea, and vomiting.\nPhysical therapy and rehabilitation date back to the ancient practice of using physical techniques and methods, such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation, in the treatment of certain conditions. These may be applied to increase function, control pain, and speed the patient toward full recovery.\nPlacebos offer some individuals pain relief although whether and how they have an effect is mysterious and somewhat controversial. Placebos are inactive substances, such as sugar pills, or harmless procedures, such as saline injections or sham surgeries, generally used in clinical studies as control factors to help determine the efficacy of active treatments. Although placebos have no direct effect on the underlying causes of pain, evidence from clinical studies suggests that many pain conditions such as migraine headache, back pain, post-surgical pain, rheumatoid arthritis, angina, and depression sometimes respond well to them. This positive response is known as the placebo effect, which is defined as the observable or measurable change that can occur in patients after administration of a placebo. Some experts believe the effect is psychological and that placebos work because the patients believe or expect them to work. Others say placebos relieve pain by stimulating the brain's own analgesics and setting the body's self-healing forces in motion. A third theory suggests that the act of taking placebos relieves stress and anxiety-which are known to aggravate some painful conditions-and, thus, cause the patients to feel better. Still, placebos are considered controversial because by definition they are inactive and have no actual curative value.\nR.I.C.E. - Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation - are four components prescribed by many orthopedists, coaches, trainers, nurses, and other professionals for temporary muscle or joint conditions, such as sprains or strains. While many common orthopedic problems can be controlled with these four simple steps, especially when combined with over-the-counter pain relievers, more serious conditions may require surgery or physical therapy, including exercise, joint movement or manipulation, and stimulation of muscles.\nSurgery, although not always an option, may be required to relieve pain, especially pain caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries. Surgery may take the form of a nerve block (see Nerve Blocks in the Appendix) or it may involve an operation to relieve pain from a ruptured disc. Surgical procedures for back problems include discectomy or, when microsurgical techniques are used, microdiscectomy, in which the entire disc is removed; laminectomy, a procedure in which a surgeon removes only a disc fragment, gaining access by entering through the arched portion of a vertebra; and spinal fusion, a procedure where the entire disc is removed and replaced with a bone graft. In a spinal fusion, the two vertebrae are then fused together. Although the operation can cause the spine to stiffen, resulting in lost flexibility, the procedure serves one critical purpose: protection of the spinal cord. Other operations for pain include rhizotomy, in which a nerve close to the spinal cord is cut, and cordotomy, where bundles of nerves within the spinal cord are severed. Cordotomy is generally used only for the pain of terminal cancer that does not respond to other therapies. Another operation for pain is the dorsal root entry zone operation, or DREZ, in which spinal neurons corresponding to the patient's pain are destroyed surgically. Because surgery can result in scar tissue formation that may cause additional problems, patients are well advised to seek a second opinion before proceeding. Occasionally, surgery is carried out with electrodes that selectively damage neurons in a targeted area of the brain. These procedures rarely result in long-term pain relief, but both physician and patient may decide that the surgical procedure will be effective enough that it justifies the expense and risk. In some cases, the results of an operation are remarkable. For example, many individuals suffering from trigeminal neuralgia who are not responsive to drug treatment have had great success with a procedure called microvascular decompression, in which tiny blood vessels are surgically separated from surrounding nerves."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the symptoms of Abdominal aortic aneurysm?", "output": "Aneurysms develop slowly over many years and often have no symptoms.

These deposits occur naturally with age and have no relationship with the amount of calcium in the diet. Approximately 2% of all people have a bicuspid aortic valve, which increases the risk of these calcifications and makes them more likely to develop aortic stenosis. Worldwide, aortic stenosis occurs most commonly in those who've had rheumatic fever, a condition that may develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 - 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is increasingly rare in the United States.\nAortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), or it may develop later in life (acquired). Children with aortic stenosis may have other congenital conditions. Radiation treatment to the chest, and some medications may cause aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is not common. It occurs more often in men than in women.\nAs the aortic valve becomes more narrow, the pressure increases inside the lower chamber of the heart (the left ventricle). This causes the left ventricle to become thicker, decreasing blood flow and can lead to chest pain. As the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs, and you may feel short of breath. Severe forms of aortic stenosis prevent enough blood from reaching the brain and rest of the body. This can cause lightheadedness and fainting."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Aortic stenosis ?", "output": "Aortic stenosis occurs more often in men than in women.

However, surgery does have the potential to cure a person's aortic stenosis. The success of surgery depends on a number of factors, including patient age, overall activity level, and presence of other medical conditions. As with any operation, aortic valve surgery has some risks, most of which occur during the first 1-2 days after surgery. These include an irregular heart rhythm and blood clots in the legs. There is also a chance that the new or repaired valve may stop working which might require another surgery."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What Causes An Aortic Valve To Malfunction?", "output": "The aortic valve to malfunction for several reasons. For example, the aortic valve may be abnormal from birth (congenital aortic valve disease), or it could become diseased with age (acquired aortic valve disease).\nThe most common congenital abnormality is a bicuspid aortic valve. As shown below, the aortic valve normally has three leaflets, but a bicuspid aortic valve has only two. It may, therefore, not open or close completely.\nA bicuspid aortic valve is a common abnormality and occurs in 1-2% of people. This is the second most common cause of aortic valve disease requiring surgery. Such valves may function normally for years before becoming stenotic, regurgitant, or both. People with a bicuspid aortic valve require antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures but generally no other special precautions are required other than regular follow up with a qualified cardiologist.\nThe most common cause of aortic valve disease requiring surgery is called \"senile aortic calcification,\" meaning that the valve has worn out with age. When a valve becomes worn, the body deposits calcium on it for reasons that are unknown. The calcium restricts or limits the motion of the valve leaflets. This may prevent the valve from opening (causing stenosis) or closing (causing leakage or regurgitation). Less common causes of aortic valve disease include diseases of the aorta, the main blood vessel coming out of the heart and carrying blood to the rest of the body, including ascending aortic aneurysms, aortic dissection, and Marfan's syndrome."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Are There Any Warning Signs For A Failing Aortic Valve?", "output": "A failing aortic valve may cause a variety of symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain (angina pectoris), and dizziness or loss of consciousness (passing out).\nA narrow valve makes the heart work harder just to pump the blood through the valve to the body. A leaky valve lets blood back into the heart after it has been pumped out. The heart must therefore pump more blood forward to make up for the blood that is leaking backwards. Either way the extra work may cause symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath. Early on the shortness of breath may be noticeable only with exercise. Later, with the progression of valve disease, a patient could experience shortness of breath with even light activity or at rest. Some patients will be unable to sleep flat in bed or may awaken from sleep short of breath. Another sign of heart failure that may occasionally occur is swelling of your feet, particularly prominent later in the afternoon or evening although other conditions, such as varicose veins, can also cause this to occur.\nThe extra work the heart has to perform may also cause chest pain or angina pectoris similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. It may be difficult to tell the difference between heart valve disease and narrowing of the blood vessels to the heart itself (coronary arteries).\nAortic valve disease may also cause dizziness, light headedness or even fainting spells."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "How Does Someone Know If They Should Have Surgery To Repair An Aortic Valve?", "output": "The decision to proceed with surgery should be made with your medical care team which usually consists of a thoracic or cardiothoracic surgeon and a cardiologist. Your medical team will likely base their recommendations on your symptoms and on the results of several tests including an echocardiogram and sometimes cardiac catheterization. An echocardiogram may show enlargement of the heart, and can help to measure the degree of stenosis or regurgitation. A cardiac catheterization provides similar information, but can also identify any narrowings of the coronary arteries."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What Options Exist For The Replacement Of Artificial Valves?", "output": "Unlike the mitral valve which can often be repaired, the aortic valve usually requires replacement. Once the decision is made to proceed with surgery, choices regarding the type of artificial valve (prosthesis) used should be considered. In broad terms there are two types of artificial valves or prostheses: mechanical valves and biological valves. Examples of the valves that your cardiothoracic surgeon might use are pictured below."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Are There Differences Between Mechanical And Biological Replacement Valves?", "output": "A number of excellent mechanical replacement valves or prostheses are available today. Most surgeons have a particular preference for one valve over another related to technical factors (how they are sewn into place), however from the patient's point of view there is little if any difference between valves. The principle advantage of mechanical valves is their excellent durability. From a practical standpoint, they do not wear out. The principle disadvantage is that there is a tendency for blood to clot on all mechanical valves. Therefore patients with artificial valves must take anticoagulants or \"blood thinners\" for the rest of their life. There is also a small but definite risk of blood clots causing stroke.\nThere are a variety of natural or biological valves that can be used to replace an abnormal valve. They all share a reduced risk of blood clots forming but all are less durable than mechanical valves. Given enough time, they will probably all wear out. The options in this category include \"xenograft\" valves made from animal tissues (most often pig aortic valves), \"homograft\" or \"allograft\" valves retrieved from human cadavers, and \"pulmonary autograft\" valves moved from the patient's pulmonary artery on the right side of the heart to the aortic position on the left.\nThe decision on the type of valve used should be made in conjunction with your cardiothoracic surgeon and your cardiologist. Ultimately the choice will depend on a patient's preferences, lifestyle, and individual risks as determined by age and other medical conditions."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Why Is Surgery Necessary?", "output": "The aortic valve is the outflow valve of the left side of the heart, meaning that it opens during systole (when the ventricle contracts or squeezes blood out into the aorta and the rest of the body). When the aortic valve is too narrow or stenotic, the ventricle has to work harder to pump the blood out to the body. This extra work consumes significant energy and ultimately requires extra blood flow to the heart itself. If there is not enough blood flow, the heart becomes ischemic causing anginal chest pain. Aortic stenosis is often progressive, growing worse with time. As the valve gets tighter, the heart has to continue to work harder and harder to keep pumping blood out of the heart. At some point the heart can no longer compensate, resulting in episodes of low blood pressure or hypotension or even syncope. As the heart fails to compensate, fluid will build up in the lungs creating congestion.\nWhen the aortic valve leaks, the heart has to work harder and similar problem occur. The ventricle must pump more blood with each contraction to produce the same forward output, creating a condition called volume overload. The heart can compensate for this volume overload for many months or years provided the leakage develops slowly. Eventually, the heart begins to fail producing shortness of breath and fatigue."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What Are The Risks Of Surgery?", "output": "Individual risks of surgery can be best estimated by your cardiothoracic surgeon and cardiologist.

Anticoagulation (\"blood thinners\") with a drug like Coumadin may be prescribed for 6 weeks to 3 months after surgery for those with biological valves, and for life for those with mechanical valves. Once the wounds have healed, most patients should experience few if any restrictions to activity.

This will make you fall into a pain-free sleep.\nThere are several different ways to do minimally invasive aortic valve surgery. Techniques include laparoscopy or endoscopy, robot-assisted surgery, and percutaneous surgery.\nYour surgeon may make a 2-inch to 3-inch cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). Muscles in the area will be divided. This allows the surgeon to reach your heart and aortic valve. For the endoscopic, or keyhole, approach, your surgeon makes one to four small holes in your chest. Then your surgeon uses special instruments and a camera to do the surgery. For robotically-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes two to four tiny cuts (about 1/2 to 3/4 inches) in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. The surgeon sees a three-dimensional view of the heart and aortic valve on the computer. This method is very precise.\nYou will need to be on a heart-lung machine for all of these surgeries.\nIf your aortic valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place.

These valves last the longest, but you will need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin, for the rest of your life. Biological: made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 to 12 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.\nIn some cases, you will have coronary artery bypass surgery, or surgery to replace the first part of the aorta (large blood vessel leaving the heart) at the same time.\nOnce the new valve is working, your surgeon will:\nClose the small cut to your heart or aorta Place catheters (flexible tubes) around your heart to drain fluids that build up Close the surgical cut in your muscles and skin\nThe surgery may take 3 to 6 hours.\nAortic valve surgery can also be done through a groin artery.

The electrial impulse that signals your heart to contract in a synchronized way begins in the sinoatrial node (SA node). This node is your heart's natural pacemaker.\nThe signal leaves the SA node and travels through the two upper chambers (atria). Then the signal passes through another node (the AV node), and finally, through the lower chambers (ventricles). This path enables the chambers to contract in a coordinated fashion.\nIn atrial fibrillation, the atria are stimulated to contract very quickly and differently from the normal pattern. The impulses are sent to the ventricles in an irregular pattern. This makes the ventricles beat abnormally, leading to an irregular (and usually fast) pulse. In atrial flutter, the ventricles may beat very fast, but in a regular pattern.

Sudden cardiac arrest can lead to sudden cardiac death."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What causes Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia?", "output": "CPVT is caused by a gene defect (abnormal gene). Genes are part of your DNA, the material passed down from parents to children, which can be passed down through families and inherited in different ways (from either one or both parents). In some cases, CPVT is autosomal dominant which means you need an abnormal gene from only one of your parents to have it. In other cases, CPVT is autosomal recessive which means you need an abnormal gene from both of your parents to get the disease. CPVT can result from mutations in genes such as RYR2 and CASQ2. RYR2 gene mutations cause about half of all cases, while mutations in the CASQ2 gene account for 1 percent to 2 percent of cases. The RYR2 and CASQ2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that help maintain a regular heartbeat. For the heart to beat normally, heart muscle cells called myocytes must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Both the RYR2 and CASQ2 proteins are involved in handling calcium within myocytes, which is critical for the regular contraction of these cells. Mutations in either the RYR2 and CASQ2 gene disrupt the handling of calcium within myocytes.

More often, both sides of the heart are involved.\nHeart failure is present when:\nYour heart muscle cannot pump (eject) the blood out of the heart very well. This is called systolic heart failure.\nYour heart muscles are stiff and do not fill up with blood easily. This is called diastolic heart failure.\nBoth of these problems mean the heart is no longer able to pump enough oxygen-rich blood out to the rest of your body, especially when you exercise or are active.\nAs the heart's pumping action is lost, blood may back up in other areas of the body. Fluid builds up in the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the arms and legs. This is called congestive heart failure.\nThe most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD), a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart.\nHeart failure can also occur when an infection weakens the heart muscle. This condition is called cardiomyopathy.\nOther heart problems that may cause heart failure are:\nCongenital heart disease Heart attack Heart valve disease Some types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\nOther diseases that can cause or contribute to heart failure:\nEmphysema Overactive thyroid Severe anemia Underactive thyroid"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Congestive heart failure ?", "output": "Certain factors increase your risk of getting heart disease, then increase your risk of getting heart failure.

The following factors may help the doctor estimate the prognosis.\nThe severity of the symptoms: It is well established that patients who have more severe symptoms of heart failure do not survive as long as those who have mild symptoms. For example, patients with class IV heart failure have the poorest prognosis, while patients with class I have the best.\nHeart function: The ejection fraction of left ventricle (LVEF) is an important indicator of the prognosis. The more severely damaged your heart muscle is, the worse your ejection fraction and worse prognosis will be, regardless of your symptoms.\nThe causes of heart failure: Heart failure associated with alcohol use or pregnancy may spontaneously recover itself over time. Heart failure can be caused by treatable conditions such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, anemia, or vitamin deficiency. The prognosis of these conditions are generally excellent. Heart failure as a result of a valve condition may also be reversible if the valve problem is recognized early and fixed before permanent damage happens. People with heart failure caused by severe hypertension may see considerable improvement of their symptoms when they control their hypertension. But the majority of patients have heart failure as a result of coronary artery disease (CAD) have a worse prognosis and a higher death rate than people who have heart failure that is not a result of CAD.\nHow long you've had heart failure: There is no specific length of time after which your heart function is unlikely to improve. General speaking, the longer you have had heart failure, the poorer prognosis may be even with appropriate treatment.\nCompensatory factors: \"compensatory factors\" are various adjustments to correct the effects of heart failure on other organs. When heart failure occurs, various hormone levels including renin, aldosterone, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide, and prostaglandin, may increase.

You may have CABG that day or the day after."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What to expect during coronary artery bypass grafting?", "output": "Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) requires a team of experts. A cardiothoracic surgeon does the surgery with support from an anesthesiologist, perfusionist (heart-lung bypass machine specialist), other surgeons, and nurses. There are several types of CABG. They range from traditional surgery in which the chest is opened to reach the heart, to nontraditional surgery in which small incisions (cuts) are made to bypass the blocked or narrowed artery.\nThis type of surgery usually lasts 3 to 5 hours, depending on the number of arteries being bypassed. Numerous steps take place during traditional CABG. You'll be under general anesthesia for the surgery. The term \"anesthesia\" refers to a loss of feeling and awareness. General anesthesia temporarily puts you to sleep. During the surgery, the anesthesiologist checks your heartbeat, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and breathing. A breathing tube is placed in your lungs through your throat. The tube is connected to a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe). An incision is made down the center of your chest. The chest bone is then cut and your ribcage is opened so that the surgeon can get to your heart. Medicines are used to stop your heart, which allows the surgeon to operate on it while it's not beating. You're also given medicines to protect your heart function during the time that it's not beating. A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood moving throughout your body during the surgery. An artery or vein is taken from your body\u2014for example, from your chest or leg\u2014and prepared to be used as a graft for the bypass. In surgery with several bypasses, both artery and vein grafts are commonly used.\nArtery grafts. These grafts are much less likely than vein grafts to become blocked over time. The left internal mammary artery most often is used for an artery graft. It's located inside the chest, close to the heart. Arteries from the arm or other places in the body are sometimes used as well.\nVein grafts. Although veins are commonly used as grafts, they're more likely than artery grafts to develop plaque and become blocked over time. The saphenous vein\u2014a long vein running along the inner side of the leg\u2014is typically used.\nAfter the grafting is done, blood flow to your heart is restored. Usually, the heart starts beating again on its own. In some cases, mild electric shocks are used to restart the heart. You're then disconnected from the heart-lung bypass machine. Tubes are inserted into your chest to drain fluid. The surgeon uses wires to close your chest bone (much like how a broken bone is repaired). The wires stay in your body permanently. After your chest bone heals, it will be as strong as it was before the surgery. Stitches or staples are used to close the skin incision. The breathing tube is removed when you're able to breathe without it.\nNontraditional CABG includes off-pump CABG and minimally invasive CABG.\nOff-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: This type of surgery can be used to bypass any of the coronary (heart) arteries. Off-pump CABG also is called beating heart bypass grafting because the heart isn't stopped and a heart-lung bypass machine isn't used. Instead, the part of the heart where grafting is being done is steadied with a mechanical device.\nMinimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting: There are several types of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) grafting. These types of surgery differ from traditional bypass surgery. They only require small incisions rather than opening the chest bone to get to the heart. These procedures sometimes use a heart-lung bypass machine.\nThis procedure is done through small incisions (ports) made in your chest. Artery or vein grafts are used. A heart-lung bypass machine is used during this procedure.\nThis type of procedure allows for even smaller, keyhole-sized incisions. A small video camera is inserted in one incision to show the heart, while the surgeon uses remote-controlled surgical instruments to do the surgery. A heart-lung bypass machine is sometimes used during this procedure."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the risks of coronary artery bypass grafting?", "output": "Although complications from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are uncommon, the risks include:\nWound infection and bleeding.\nReactions to anesthesia.\nFever.\nPain.\nStroke, heart attack, or even death.\nSome patients develop a fever associated with chest pain, irritability, and decreased appetite. This is due to inflammation involving the lung and heart sac. This complication sometimes is seen 1 to 6 weeks after surgeries that involve cutting through the pericardium (the outer covering of the heart). This reaction usually is mild. However, some patients may develop fluid buildup around the heart that requires treatment. Memory loss and other changes, such as problems concentrating or thinking clearly, may occur in some people. These changes are more likely to occur in people who are older, who have high blood pressure or lung disease, or who drink excessive amounts of alcohol. These side effects often improve several months after surgery. Use of a heart-lung bypass machine increases the risk of blood clots forming in your blood vessels. Clots can travel to the brain or other parts of the body and block the flow of blood, which may cause a stroke or other problems. Recent technical improvements in heart-lung bypass machines are helping reduce the risk of blood clots forming. In general, the risk of complications is higher if CABG is done in an emergency situation (for example, during a heart attack), if you're older than 70, or if you have a history of smoking. Your risk also is higher if you have other diseases or conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, lung disease, or peripheral arterial disease."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What to expect after coronary artery bypass grafting?", "output": "After surgery, you'll typically spend 1 or 2 days in an Intensive care unit (ICU). Your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels will be checked regularly during this time. An intravenous line (IV) will likely be inserted into a vein in your arm. Through the IV line, you may get medicines to control blood circulation and blood pressure. You also will likely have a tube in your bladder to drain urine and a tube to drain fluid from your chest. You may receive oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs or a mask) and a temporary pacemaker while in the ICU. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms. Your doctor may recommend that you wear compression stockings on your legs as well. These stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go up the leg. This creates gentle pressure up the leg. The pressure keeps blood from pooling and clotting. While in the ICU, you'll also have bandages on your chest incision (cut) and on the areas where an artery or vein was removed for grafting. After you leave the ICU, you'll be moved to a less intensive care area of the hospital for 3 to 5 days before going home.\nYour doctor will give you specific instructions for recovering at home, especially concerning:\nHow to care for your healing incisions.\nHow to recognize signs of infection or other complications.\nWhen to call the doctor right away.\nWhen to make followup appointments.\nYou also may get instructions on how to deal with common side effects from surgery. Side effects often go away within 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, but may include:\nDiscomfort or itching from healing incisions.\nSwelling of the area where an artery or vein was removed for grafting.\nMuscle pain or tightness in the shoulders and upper back.\nFatigue (tiredness), mood swings, or depression.\nProblems sleeping or loss of appetite.\nConstipation.\nChest pain around the site of the chest bone incision (more frequent with traditional CABG).\nFull recovery from traditional CABG may take 6 to 12 weeks or more. Less recovery time is needed for nontraditional CABG. Your doctor will tell you when you can start physical activity again. It varies from person to person, but there are some typical timeframes. Most people can resume sexual activity within about 4 weeks and driving after 3 to 8 weeks. Returning to work after 6 weeks is common unless your job involves specific and demanding physical activity. Some people may need to find less physically demanding types of work or work a reduced schedule at first.\nCare after surgery may include periodic checkups with doctors. During these visits, tests may be done to see how your heart is working. Tests may include EKG (electrocardiogram), stress testing, echocardiography, and cardiac CT. CABG is not a cure for coronary heart disease (CHD). You and your doctor may develop a treatment plan that includes lifestyle changes to help you stay healthy and reduce the chance of CHD getting worse. Lifestyle changes may include making changes to your diet, quitting smoking, doing physical activity regularly, and lowering and managing stress. Your doctor also may refer you to cardiac rehabilitation (rehab). Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that helps improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. Rehab programs include exercise training, education on heart healthy living, and counseling to reduce stress and help you return to an active life. Doctors supervise these programs, which may be offered in hospitals and other community facilities. Talk to your doctor about whether cardiac rehab might benefit you. Taking medicines as prescribed also is an important part of care after surgery.

This can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, heart attack, and other symptoms, usually when you are active.\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States for men and women."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at risk for Coronary heart disease?", "output": "Many things increase your risk for heart disease:\nMen in their 40s have a higher risk of CHD than women. But as women get older (especially after they reach menopause), their risk increases to almost equal that of a man's risk.\nBad genes (heredity) can increase your risk. You are more likely to develop the condition if someone in your family has a history of heart disease -- especially if they had it before age 50. Your risk for CHD goes up the older you get.\nDiabetes is a strong risk factor for heart disease.\nHigh blood pressure increases your risks of coronary artery disease and heart failure.\nAbnormal cholesterol levels: your LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol should be as low as possible, and your HDL (\"good\") cholesterol should be as high as possible to reduce your risk of CHD.\nMetabolic syndrome refers to high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, excess body fat around the waist, and increased insulin levels. People with this group of problems have an increased chance of getting heart disease.\nSmokers have a much higher risk of heart disease than nonsmokers.\nChronic kidney disease can increase your risk.\nAlready having atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries in another part of your body (examples are stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm) increases your risk of having coronary heart disease.\nOther risk factors include alcohol abuse, not getting enough exercise, and having excessive amounts of stress.\nHigher-than-normal levels of inflammation-related substances, such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen are being studied as possible indicators of an increased risk for heart disease.\nIncreased levels of a chemical called homocysteine, an amino acid, are also linked to an increased risk of a heart attack."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "How to know you have a Coronary heart disease?", "output": "Many tests help diagnose CHD. Usually, your doctor will order more than one test before making a definite diagnosis.\nTests may include:\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) Exercise stress test Echocardiogram Magnetic resonance angiography Nuclear scan Electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) to look for calcium in the lining of the arteries: the more calcium, the higher your chance for CHD CT angiography -- a noninvasive way to perform coronary angiography Coronary angiography /arteriography -- an invasive procedure designed to evaluate the heart arteries under x-ray"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What Procedure to Choose?", "output": "Although many indications are the same for performing either PCI or CABG, these two procedures have inherently different mechanisms.  While PCI mitigates an obstruction, it can not prevent plaque progression or rupture in other involved segments of the artery. On the contrary, CABG is able to prevent future ischemic insults caused by plaque progression or rupture in other involved segments of the artery. Most studies report the same outcome with PCI and CABG, but there are some reports that favor CABG over PCI: The SYNTAX trial with 705 patients demonstrated a significantly higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality rate among those who received PCI than the CABG cohort.  Two Studies reported that CABG is more effective in prevention of late spontaneous MI when compared to PCI.   ACA 2021 revascularization guideline recommends to consider the following factors to decide whether to chose PCI or CABG:  SYNTAX Score  SYNTAX score derived from a clinical trial with the same name which predicts the grade of the anatomic complexity and can be used as a decision-making tool. This score is a guide for selection of a revascularization procedure in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. All cause mortality rate among patients with a coronary artery disease -associated SYNTAX score equal or greater than 33 were significantly lower when undergone CABG than PCI For patients with SYNTAX score lower than 33, no differences have been report in mortality rate of CABG and PCI Compliance to medications Preferences of patient Individual factors, such as anatomic complexity, which is discussed in the following table: \n\n\nPCI would help patients with STEMI and ischemic symptoms for less than 12 hours.  Rescue PCI is recommended for STEMI patients who failed re-perfusion after fibrinolytic therapy to improve the survival.    PCI has been related to improved survival rate when done in STEMI patients who are stable and presented 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset.  Regardless of time from MI, PCI can increase survival in STEMI patients who developed complications such as ongoing ischemia, acute sever heart failure, or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.  Performing the PCI is not beneficial in stable and asymptomatic STEMI patients who have a totally occluded infarct artery >24 hours after symptom onset with no evidence for sever ischemia.  The role of PCI in asymptomatic STEMI patients who are presenting after 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset is not well studied.  However, based on a small trial named BRAVE-2 a reduction in left ventricular infarct size has been reported among asymptomatic STEMI patients who were treated with an invasive strategy of coronary stent within 12 to 48 hours after symptom onset, compared to conservative therapies.  Both PCI and CABG are indicated in patients with STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and hemodynamic instability.  CABG is recommended for patients with STEMI who have mechanical complications such as ventricular septal rupture, mitral regurgitation because of papillary muscle infarction or rupture, or free wall rupture.  Emergent or urgent CABG is recommended in STEMI patients whose PCI is not feasible with a large area of myocardial involvement. On the other hand, emergent or urgent CABG should be avoided in these patients in the absence of ischemia or large myocardial involvement. Furthermore, CABG is usually avoided if patients' distal targets are poor.   The following algorithm demonstrates the proper revascularization in STEMI patients. \n\n\nThe sole condition that fibrinolytic therapies are superior to PCI is when the duration from hospital presentation to PCI is anticipated to be more than 120 minutes. An early revascularization strategy could increase the survival rate in patients with STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock.\nFractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) are commonly used to assess the lesion significant. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) compares the maximal blood flow distal to the lesion to the normal maximal blood flow. On the other hand iFR compares the instantaneous wave-free ratio of the coronary pressure distal to the lesion during the diastole with the aortic pressure.  Reported in numbers of trials which used FFR, FFR -guided PCI was successful in lowering the revascularization rate, procedure-related chest pain in patients with stable coronary artery disease and functionally significant stenosis.    In one of these trials patients with abnormal FFR significantly benefited from PCI over medical therapy with lower rate of ischemia -driven revascularization and shorter procedural time.  FFR -guided revascularization with CABG was more off-pump with fewer anastomosis and simpler procedure compared to CABG with angiogram -guided revascularization in one of the clinical trials.    Although other studies reported similar outcomes in both.   iFR measure does not require the administration of adenosine has been also studied in clinical trials. Results supported that this measure is not inferior to FFR and also showed less adverse outcome related to the procedure.  Lower rate of long-term major adverse cardiac events has been reported when PCI was deferred with FFR greater than 0.80 or iFR that is >0.89. One of the trials named DEFER (Deferral of Percutaneous Intervention) reported that the rate of adverse outcome cardiac outcomes is similar in both group of patients whose PCI has been deferred either with a FFR greater than 0.75 or intermediate angiographic measures."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "How a coronary risk profile performed?", "output": "Blood is typically drawn from a vein, usually from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.

Sometimes emotional distress, such as anxiety, can lead to difficulty breathing.\nThe following problems may cause breathing difficulty:\nProblems with the lungs: Blood clot in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary embolism) Bronchiolitis Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and other chronic lung problems Pneumonia Pulmonary hypertension\nProblems with the airways leading to the lungs: Choking on something stuck in the airways Croup Epiglottitis\nProblems with the heart: Heart attack or angina Heart defects from birth (congenital heart disease) Heart failure Heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias)\nOther problems: Allergies (such as to mold, dander, or pollen) Climbing to high altitudes where there is less oxygen in the air Compression of the chest wall Dust in the environment Hiatal hernia Obesity Panic attacks"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the symptoms of Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve?", "output": "Symptoms of Ebstein's anomaly develop after birth and include bluish-colored lips and nails due to low blood oxygen levels.

Ebstein's anomaly occurs as a baby develops in the womb. This condition is rare but it is more common among Caucasians. The tricuspid valve is made up of three parts, called leaflets or flaps. These leaflets or flaps allow blood to flow from the right atrium (top chamber) to the right ventricle (bottom chamber) while the heart relaxes. The leaflets close to prevent blood from flowing from the right ventricle to the right atrium while the heart pumps.The leaflets are unusually deep in the right ventricle and are often larger than normal in cases of Ebstein's anomaly. Due to the defect, blood may go the wrong way back into the right atrium, when it should be flowing to the right ventricle. When the blood gets backed up it can lead to heart swelling and fluid buildup in the lungs or liver. Sometimes, blood can't get out of the heart into the lungs and the person may appear blue. However in most cases of Ebstein's anomaly, patients have a hole in the wall which separates the heart's two upper chambers and the blood may flow across the hole. This may cause oxygen -poor blood to go to the rest of the body.

Most often, babies with this condition are born with a hole between the two pumping chambers -- the left and right ventricles -- of the heart (ventricular septal defect). The hole allows blood that has already picked up oxygen from the lungs to flow back into the lungs, instead of going out to the rest of the body. Other heart defects that can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome include:\nAtrioventricular canal defect Atrial septal defect Cyanotic heart disease Patent ductus arteriosus Truncus arteriosus\nOver time, increased blood flow can damage the small blood vessels in the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs. As a result, the blood backs up and does not go to the lungs to pick up oxygen.

Most people who develop infectious endocarditis have underlying heart disease or valve problems. However, an organism commonly found in the mouth, Streptococcus viridans, is responsible for about 50% of all bacterial endocarditis cases. This is why dental procedures increase your chances for developing this condition. Such procedures are especially risky for children with congenital heart conditions. As a result, it is common practice for children with some forms of congenital heart disease and adults with certain heart-valve conditions to take antibiotics before any dental work.

If each stroke costs $100,000 over the lifetime of the patient then preventing 1.12 fewer cases with dabigatran would save $112,000.\nIn addition to the small but statistically significant reduction in mortality associated with Dabigatran therapy, there were also numerically (but not statistically significantly) fewer major bleeds (3.4% vs 3.1% per year). The cost of a major bleed is estimated to be $8000 (personal communication, Dr. David Cohen). The cost of treating 200 patients with dabigatran would be reduced slightly by 0.6 bleeds or $4,800 dollars.\nThere was an increased risk of MI of 0.21% (p=0.048) for dabigatran vs Warfarin (0.74% - 0.53%/year).

Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired) either from a disease, medication or surgery.\nOne form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.\nIn pregnant patients, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.\nCongenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\nMany factors can cause acquired heart block. Examples include:\nDamage to the heart from a heart attack. This is the most common cause of acquired heart block. Coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Heart failure. Rheumatic fever. Cardiomyopathy, or heart muscle diseases. Sarcoidosis Degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease. Certain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block. Exposure to toxic substances and taking certain medications - including digitalis, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers - also may cause heart block. Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medications for signs of problems. Some types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes). An overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your bdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate.\nIn some cases, acquired heart blockmay go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.\nAlso, if a medication is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medication is stopped or the dosage is lowered. Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medications."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Heart block ?", "output": "The risk factors for congenital and acquired heart block are different.\nIf a pregnant patient has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, her fetus is at risk for heart block.\nAutoimmune diseases can cause the body to make proteins called antibodies that can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These antibodies may damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.\nCongenital heart defects also may result in congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Most of the time, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\nHeredity may play a role in certain heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect may be more likely than other people to have a child with the condition.\nAcquired heart block can occur in people of any age. However, most types of the disorder are more common in older people. This is because many of the risk factors are more common in older people.\nPeople who have a history of heart disease or heart attacks are more likely to have heart block. Examples of heart disease that can lead to heart block include heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle diseases).\nOther diseases also may raise the risk of heart block. These include sarcoidosis and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease.\nExposure to toxic substances or taking certain medicines, such as digitalis, also can raise your risk of heart block.\nWell-trained athletes and young people are at higher risk for first-degree heart block caused by an overly active vagus nerve. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen.

If you have second-degree heart block that doesn't require a pacemaker, talk with your doctor about keeping your heart healthy. Your doctor will tell you whether you need ongoing care for your condition. People who have third-degree heart block and some people who have second-degree heart block need pacemakers. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. If you have a pacemaker, you should take special care to avoid things that may interfere with it. Avoid close or prolonged contact with electrical devices and devices that have strong magnetic fields. These objects can keep your pacemaker from working properly. Let all of your doctors, dentists, and medical technicians know that you have a pacemaker. You also should notify airport screeners. Your doctor can give you a card that states what kind of pacemaker you have. Carry this card in your wallet. You may want to consider wearing a medical ID bracelet or necklace that states that you have a pacemaker. Certain medical procedures can disrupt pacemakers. Examples include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrocauterization during surgery, and shockwave lithotripsy to get rid of kidney stones. Your doctor may need to check your pacemaker several times a year to make sure it is working well. Some pacemakers must be checked in the doctor's office, but others can be checked over the phone.

The first 24 to 48 hours will likely be in the intensive care unit (ICU). During the first few days after a transplant, you will need close follow-up to make sure that you do not get an infection and your heart is working well.\nThe recovery period is about 6 months. Often, your transplant team will ask you to stay fairly close to the hospital for the first 3 months. You will need to have regular check-ups with blood tests, x-rays, and echocardiograms for many years.\nFighting rejection is an ongoing process. The body's immune system considers the transplanted organ an infection and fights it. For this reason, organ transplant patients must take drugs that suppress the body's immune response. Taking medicines and following your doctor's instructions carefully is very important to preventing rejection.\nBiopsies of the heart muscle are often done every month during the first 6 to 12 months after transplant, and then less often after that. This helps the doctor determine if your body is rejecting the new heart, even before you have symptoms.\nYou must take drugs that prevent transplant rejection for the rest of your life. You will need to understand how to take these medications, and know their side effects.\nYou can go back to your normal activities as soon as you feel well enough, and after talking with your doctor. However, avoid vigorous physical activity.\nTo make sure that you do not develop coronary disease after a transplant, you will have cardiac catheterization every year.\nHeart transplant prolongs the life of patients who would otherwise die. About 80% of heart transplant patients are alive 2 years after the operation. At 5 years, 70% of people will still be alive after a heart transplant.\nThe main problem, as with other transplants, is rejection.

Central cyanosis often increases with crying."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What causes Hypoplastic left heart syndrome?", "output": "Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. Approximately 10% of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.\nThe problem develops before birth when there is not enough growth of the left ventricle and other structures, including the:\nAorta - the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body Entrance and exit of the ventricle Mitral and aortic valves\nThis causes the left ventricle and aorta to be incompletely developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.\nIn patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for a while, but this extra workload eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.\nThe only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and the left side of the heart, or between the arteries and pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two of these connections:\nForamen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium) Ductus arteriosus (a small blood vesel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)\nBoth of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.\nIn babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. If the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body. Babies with known hypoplastic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosus open.\nBecause there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood returning to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die.

Early signs and symptoms (3 to 30 days after tick bite): The first symptom is usually a red rash at the site of tick bite, which may look like a bullseye, but not all people with Lyme disease have a rash. The rash is called erythema chronicum migrans or erythema migrans (EM). EM occurs in approximately 70 to 80 percent of infected persons. EM begins at the site of a tick bite after a delay of 3 to 30 days (average is about 7 days). EM expands gradually over a period of days reaching up to 12 inches or more (30 cm) across. EM may feel warm to the touch but is rarely itchy or painful. Sometimes, EM clears as it enlarges, resulting in a target or bullseye appearance. EM may appear on any area of the body but is usually present on areas including the axilla, inguinal region, popliteal fossa, or along belt line. The rash may or may not be associated with flu-like symptoms including: Fever and/or chills Headache Body aches Joint aches Stiff neck Fatigue Classic Lyme disease rash - Source: CDC.gov\nLate Signs and Symptoms (days to months after tick bite): Severe headaches and neck stiffness Multiple erythema migrans rashes on other areas of the body. Arthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, particularly of the knees and other large joints. Facial palsy (loss of muscle tone or droop on one or both sides of the face). Intermittent pain in tendons, muscles, joints, and bones. Heart palpitations or an irregular heart beat (Lyme carditis). Episodes of dizziness or shortness of breath. Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Nerve pain. Shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet. Problems with short-term memory.\nNotes Fever and other flu-like symptoms may occur in the absence of rash. A small bump or redness at the site of a tick bite that occurs immediately and resembles a mosquito bite, is common. This irritation generally goes away in 1-2 days and is not a sign of Lyme disease. A rash with a very similar appearance to EM occurs with Southern Tick-associated Rash Illness (STARI), but is not Lyme disease. Ticks can spread other organisms that may cause a different type of rash. What Causes Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by a bacterial infection you get from bite of an infected tick. The majority of Lyme disease in North America is caused by bite of black-legged tick, or deer tick (Ixodes scapularis). Other ticks that transmit Lyme disease are the sheep tick, castor bean tick, or European castor bean tick (Ixodes ricinus) in the Europe, the Western black legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) in the Pacific region of North America, and the taiga tick (Ixodes persulactus) in Europe, Central and Northern Asia, China, and Japan.

It is caused by diseases that weaken or damage the valve or its supporting structures. Mitral regurgitation becomes chronic when the condition persists rather than occurring for only a short time period. Chronic mitral regurgitation should be distinguished from acute mitral regurgitation.\nIn acute mitral regurgitation, the mitral valve doesn't close all the way and blood flows backward into the left upper heart chamber (atrium). This leads to a decrease in blood flow to the rest of the body. As a result, the heart may try to pump harder.\nAcute mitral regurgitation may be caused by dysfunction or injury to the valve following a heart attack or infection of the heart valve (infective endocarditis). These conditions may rupture the valve or surrounding structures, leaving an opening for blood to move backwards.\nMitral valve prolapse is a relatively common cause of chronic mitral regurgitation.\nAbout one-third of all cases of chronic mitral regurgitation are caused by rheumatic heart disease, a complication of untreated strep throat that is becoming less common.\nCongenital (present from birth) mitral regurgitation is rare if it is not part of a more complex heart defect or syndrome.\nChronic mitral regurgitation can also be caused by:\nAtherosclerosis Endocarditis Heart tumors High blood pressure Marfan syndrome Swelling of the left lower heart chamber Untreated syphilis (rare)\nRisk factors include an individual or family history of any of the disorders mentioned above and use of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine (appetite suppressants banned by the FDA) for 4 or more months."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Mitral regurgitation ?", "output": "Persons who already have cardiac disease, sustained trauma to the chest area, have congenital heart abnormalities, or have had endocarditis or rheumatic fever are at risk for mitral regurgitation."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "When to seek urgent medical care when I have Mitral regurgitation ?", "output": "Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation, or if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment.\nCall your health care provider if you are being treated for this condition and develop signs of infection, which include:\nChills Fever General ill feeling Headache Muscle aches"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What to expect if I have Mitral regurgitation  (Outlook/Prognosis)?", "output": "How well a patient does depends on the cause and severity of the valve leakage.

This will make you unconscious and unable to feel pain.\nThere are several different ways to perform minimally invasive mitral valve surgery.\nYour heart surgeon may make a 2-inch to 3-inch-long cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). Muscles in the area will be divided so your surgeon can reach the heart. A small cut is made in the left side of your heart so the surgeon can repair or replace the mitral valve. In endoscopic surgery, your surgeon makes one to four small holes in your chest. Then your surgeon uses special instruments and a camera to do the surgery. For robotically-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes two to four tiny cuts (about \u00c2\u00bd to \u00c2\u00be inch) in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. The surgeon sees a three-dimensional view of the heart and mitral valve on the computer. This method is very precise.\nYou may or may not need to be on a heart lung machine for these types of surgery, but if not, your heart rate will be slowed by medicine or a mechanical device.\nIf your surgeon can repair your mitral valve, you may have:\nRing annuloplasty -- The surgeon repairs the ring-like part around the valve by sewing a ring of metal, cloth, or tissue around the valve. Valve repair -- The surgeon trims, shapes, or rebuilds one or both of the leaflets of the valve. The leaflets are flaps that open and close the valve.\nIf your mitral valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called valve replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your mitral valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:\nMechanical -- made of man-made materials, such as titanium, or ceramic. These valves last the longest, but you will need to take blood thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin, for the rest of your life. Biological -- made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 - 12 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.\nThe surgery may take 2 -4 hours.\nThis surgery can also be done through a groin artery, with no cuts on your chest. The doctor sends a catheter (flexible tube) with a balloon attached on the end. The balloon stretches the opening of the valve.

Other treatments include medicines and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Your doctor will consider many factors when deciding what treatment or combination of treatments to recommend.\nCompared with CABG, some advantages of percutaneous coronary intervention are that it:\nDoesn't require an incision (cut) Doesn't require general anesthesia (that is, you won't be temporarily put to sleep during the procedure) Has a shorter recovery time\nPercutaneous coronary intervention also is used as an emergency procedure during a heart attack. As plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, it can rupture. This can cause a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface and block blood flow. The lack of oxygen-rich blood to the heart can damage the heart muscle.\nQuickly opening a blockage lessens the damage during a heart attack by restoring blood flow to the heart muscle. Percutaneous coronary intervention usually is the fastest way to open a blocked artery and is the best approach during a heart attack.\nA disadvantage of percutaneous coronary intervention, when compared with CABG, is that the artery more frequently renarrows over time. However, the risk of this happening is lower when stents are used, especially stents coated with medicines (drug-eluting stents).\nStents are small mesh tubes that support the inner artery wall. They reduce the chance of the artery becoming narrowed or blocked again. Some stents are coated with medicines that are slowly and continuously released into the artery. The medicines help prevent the artery from becoming blocked again. However, stents aren't without risks. In some cases, blood clots can form in stents and cause a heart attack.\nYour doctor will talk to you about your treatment options and which procedure is best for you."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "How is Percutaneous coronary intervention performed?", "output": "Before the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure begins, you will be given some pain medicine. You may also be given blood thinning medicines to prevent a blood clot from forming.\nYou will lie on a padded table. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube (catheter) through a surgical cut into an artery. Sometimes the catheter will be placed in your arm or wrist. You will be awake during the procedure.\nThe doctor will use live x-ray pictures to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart and arteries. Dye will be injected into your body to highlight blood flow through the arteries. This helps the doctor see any blockages in the blood vessels that lead to your heart.\nA guide wire is moved into and across the blockage. A balloon catheter is pushed over the guide wire and into the blockage. The balloon on the end is blown up (inflated). This opens the blocked vessel and restores proper blood flow to the heart.\nA wire mesh tube (stent) may then be placed in this blocked area. The stent is inserted along with the balloon catheter. It expands when the balloon is inflated. The stent is left there to help keep the artery open.\nThe stent may be coated with a drug (called a drug-eluting stent). This type of stent may lower the chance of the artery closing back up in the future. However, drug-eluting stents are slightly more likely to close in the short-term. Currently, they are only used for certain patients."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Why is the procedure performed?", "output": "Arteries can become narrowed or blocked by deposits called plaque.

Blood vessel damage from the catheters. An allergic reaction to the dye given during the percutaneous coronary intervention. An arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). The need for emergency coronary bypass surgery during the procedure (2\u20134 percent of people). This may occur if an artery closes down instead of opening up. Damage to the kidneys caused by the dye used. Heart attack (3\u20135 percent of people). Stroke (less than 1 percent of people).\nSometimes chest pain can occur during percutaneous coronary intervention because the balloon briefly blocks blood supply to the heart.\nAs with any procedure involving the heart, complications can sometimes, though rarely, cause death. Less than 2 percent of people die during percutaneous coronary intervention.\nComplications from stents include:\nAfter percutaneous coronary intervention, the treated coronary artery can become narrowed or blocked again, often within 6 months of percutaneous coronary intervention. This is called restenosis.\nStudies suggest that there's a higher risk of blood clots forming in medicine-coated stents compared to bare metal stents. However, no conclusive evidence shows that these stents increase the chances of having a heart attack or dying, if used as recommended.\nThe risk of complications is higher in:\nPeople aged 75 and older People who have kidney disease or diabetes Women People who have poor pumping function in their hearts People who have extensive heart disease and blockages in their coronary (heart) arteries"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What to expect before Percutaneous coronary intervention?", "output": "Cardiologists do coronary angioplasties at hospitals.

Often you have to stop eating and drinking by midnight the night before the procedure. What medicines you should and shouldn't take on the day of the percutaneous coronary intervention. When to arrive at the hospital and where to go.\nEven though percutaneous coronary intervention takes only 1 to 2 hours, you'll likely need to stay in the hospital overnight or longer.

Blood clots in the stent can block blood flow and cause a heart attack.\nDO NOT STOP TAKING THEM WITHOUT TALKING TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST. Stopping these medications too soon can be life-threatening.\nRecovery and Recuperation:\nMost people recover from percutaneous coronary intervention and return to work about 1 week after leaving the hospital. Your doctor will want to check your progress after you leave the hospital. During the follow-up visit, your doctor will examine you, make changes to your medicines (if needed), do any necessary tests, and check your overall recovery.\nUse this time to ask questions you may have about activities, medicines, or lifestyle changes, or to talk about any other issues that concern you.\nLifestyle Changes:\nAlthough percutaneous coronary intervention can reduce the symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD), it isn't a cure for CHD or the risk factors that led to it. Making healthy lifestyle changes can help treat CHD and maintain the good results from percutaneous coronary intervention.\nTalk with your doctor about your risk factors for CHD and the lifestyle changes you'll need to make.

This pattern repeats frequently throughout the night.\nThe main symptoms of OSA are usually associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, including falling asleep at inappropriate times. Most people also report awakening unrefreshed in the morning.\nOther symptoms may include:\nDepression Memory difficulties Morning headaches Personality changes Poor concentration Restless and fitful sleep Frequent waking up during the night to urinate Insomnia\nIt is not uncommon for children with OSA to display hyperactive behavior. Leg swelling has also been linked to severe OSA."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What causes Sleep apnea?", "output": "OSA is caused by the relaxation of the muscles of the back of the throat, which then impede airflow. Normally, the muscles of the upper part of the throat help keep the airway open and allow air to flow into the lungs. Even though these muscles usually relax during sleep, the upper throat should remain open wide enough to let air pass through unobstructed.\nSeveral factors may affect the width of the throat area, and can therefore contribute to the obstruction of the airway. Having a narrower throat area can affect the ease with which air can pass through the airways. When the muscles in the narrower upper throat relax during sleep, the airway may completely close. This prevents air from getting into the lungs and loud snoring and labored breathing occur. During deep sleep, breathing can stop for a period of time (often more than 10 seconds). This is called apnea."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Sleep apnea ?", "output": "Gender: Sleep apnea affects adult men more often than women. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 40 percent of adult men and 24 percent of adult women are considered habitual snorers , and snoring is often associated with sleep apnea.\nMetabolic Syndrome and Sleep Apnea:\nObesity: Obesity has been closely linked to OSA  in part because the extra fat around the neck can narrow the opening of the windpipe. Older obese men seem to be at higher risk since up to 40 percent of morbidly obese men in a clinical population are affected by OSA . Though it is hardly the only factor that has an effect, weight loss can alleviate some of the symptoms of OSA; losing 10 percent of body weight can reduce the number of apnea episodes throughout the night. \nDiabetes: Diabetes has also been associated with OSA independently from obesity. Studies have shown that both obese and slender people with diabetes have reported difficulty breathing while sleeping . The causal relationship, however, has not yet been established.\nHypertension: There is a definite link between hypertension and OSA. One out of every 2 people who have OSA are diagnosed with high blood pressure . The relationship between hypertension and OSA is also independent from other risk factors, including obesity.\nOther risk factors: The following factors may also increase your risk for obstructive sleep apnea:\nCertain shapes of the palate and jaw Large tonsils and adenoids in children Large neck or collar size Large tongue Narrow airway Nasal obstruction\nIn addition to these risk factors, drinking alcohol or using sedatives before sleep may exacerbate the condition and increase the likelihood of an episode of apnea.\nHaving a neck size over 17 inches for men and 16 inches for women is also a risk factor for sleep apnea. Moreover, having a deviated septum would cause a nasal obstruction that could lead to sleep apnea ."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What to expect if I have Sleep apnea  (Outlook/Prognosis)?", "output": "With the right treatment and follow-up care, the symptoms of sleep apnea should be totally corrected."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the symptoms of stroke?", "output": "Symptoms of stroke depends on the location and the area the brain damage.

Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired).\nOne form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.\nIn pregnant women, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.\nCongenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\nMany factors can cause acquired heart block. Examples include:\nDamage to the heart from a heart attack. This is the most common cause of acquired heart block. Coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Heart failure. Rheumatic fever. Cardiomyopathy, or heart muscle diseases. Sarcoidosis Degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease. Certain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block. Exposure to toxic substances and taking certain medicines - including digitalis, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers - also may cause heart block. Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medicines for signs of problems. Some types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes). An overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate.\nIn some cases, acquired heart block may go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.\nAlso, if a medicine is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered. Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medicines."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Third degree AV block ?", "output": "Elderly, particularly those with ischemic heart disease, and patients with certain disorders such as Lyme disease are at increased risk of developing complete heart block (CHB)."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "When to seek urgent medical care when I have Third degree AV block ?", "output": "Any syncope, loss of consciousnesses in a patient with known risk factors of heart disease calls for urgent medical care."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What to expect if I have Third degree AV block  (Outlook/Prognosis)?", "output": "The prognosis of patients with complete heart block is generally poor without therapy.

Progressive degeneration of the electrical conduction system of the heart can lead to third-degree heart block. This may be preceded by first-degree AV block, second-degree AV block, bundle branch block, or bifascicular block. In addition, acute myocardial infarction may present with third-degree AV block.\nAn inferior wall myocardial infarction may cause damage to the AV node, causing third-degree heart block. In this case, the damage is usually transitory. Studies have shown that third-degree heart block in the setting of an inferior wall myocardial infarction typically resolves within 2 weeks. The escape rhythm typically originates in the AV junction, producing a narrow complex escape rhythm.\nAn anterior wall myocardial infarction may damage the distal conduction system of the heart, causing third-degree heart block. This is typically extensive, permanent damage to the conduction system, necessitating a permanent pacemaker to be placed. The escape rhythm typically originates in the ventricles, producing a wide complex escape rhythm.\nThird-degree heart block may also be congenital and has been linked to the presence of lupus in the mother. It is thought that maternal antibodies may cross the placenta and attack the heart tissue during gestation. The cause of congenital third-degree heart block in many patients is unknown.

It is almost always less severe and shorter than the first outbreak. Over time, the number of outbreaks may decrease. Once a person is infected, however, the virus hides within nerve cells and remains in the body. The virus can remain \"asleep\" (dormant) for a long period of time (this is called latency). The infection can flare-up or reactivate at any time. Events that can trigger latent infection to become active and bring on an outbreak include:\nFatigue Genital irritation Menstruation Physical or emotional stress Trauma\nAttacks can recur as seldom as once per year, or so often that the symptoms seem continuous.

HSV-2 can be spread through secretions from the mouth or genitals.\nHerpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) most often causes herpes infections of the mouth and lips (commonly called cold sores or fever blisters). HSV-1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex.\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) is spread from one person to another during sexual contact. You may be infected with herpes when your skin, vagina, penis, or mouth comes into contact with someone who already has herpes.\nHerpes is most likely to be transmitted by contact with the skin of an infected person who has visible sores, blisters, or a rash (an active outbreak), but you can also catch herpes from an infected person's skin when they have NO visible sores present (and the person may not even know that he or she is infected), or from an infected persons mouth (saliva) or vaginal fluids.\nBecause the virus can be spread even when there are no symptoms or sores present, a sexual partner who has been infected with herpes in the past but has no active herpes sores can still pass the infection on to others. Genital HSV-2 infections is more common in women (approximately 1 of every 4 women is infected) than it is in men (nearly 1 of every 8 men is infected)."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "When to seek urgent medical care when I have Genital herpes ?", "output": "Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have any symptoms of genital herpes, or if you develop fever, headache, vomiting, or widespread symptoms during or after an outbreak of herpes.

More than 70 different types of HPV exist.\nSeveral types of HPV cause genital warts, which may be found on the penis, vulva, urethra, vagina, cervix, larynx, and around and in the anus. Other types of HPV cause common or flat warts on other parts of the skin, such as the hands. However, warts on the hands or other parts of the body do not cause genital warts.\nHPV infection around the genitals is common, although most people have no symptoms. Even if you do NOT have symptoms, however, you must be treated to prevent complications and spreading the condition to others. In women, HPV can invade the walls of the vagina and cervix. These warts are flat and not easy to see without special procedures. Certain types of HPV can lead to precancerous changes in the cervix, cervical cancer, or anal cancer. These are called high-risk types of HPV. The following are important facts about how HPV and genital warts can be spread:\nHPV infection is passed from one person to another through sexual contact involving the skin of the anus, mouth, or vagina, or the mucus membrane. It is possible for genital warts and HPV to spread, even when no warts can be seen. You may not see warts for at least 6 weeks to 6 months after becoming infected with HPV. It may also take longer, even years, so when you first notice genital warts, it does not mean that you or your partner has had sexual contact with someone outside of your relationship. Not everyone who has been exposed to the HPV virus and genital warts wil develop them.\nThe following factors put you at higher risk for getting genital warts, having them spread more quickly, having them return, or having other complications of HPV:\nHaving multiple sexual partners Not knowing whether someone you had sex with had STIs Becoming sexually active at an early age Using tobacco and alcohol Having stress and other viral infections (such as herpes) at the same time Being pregnant Having an immune system that does not work well, such as during cancer treatment or AIDS\nIf a child has genital warts, you should suspect sexual abuse as a possible cause."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Genital wart ?", "output": "People with history of unprotected sexual intercourse are at increased risks of genital wart."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "When to seek urgent medical care when I have Genital wart ?", "output": "A current or past sexual partner has genital warts You have visible warts on your external genitals, itching, discharge, or abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Certain types of genital warts increase a woman's risk for cancer of the cervix and vulva. Possible Complications Some types of HPV have been found to cause cancer of the cervix and vulva. They are the main cause of cervical cancer. The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types that can cause penile or anal cancer.

Systemic, or visceral leishmaniasis affects the entire body. This form occurs 2 - 8 months after a person is bitten by the sandfly. Most people do not remember having a skin sore. This form can lead to deadly complications. The parasites damage the immune system by decreasing the numbers of disease-fighting cells.

The symptoms tend to affect mainly to the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes (the soft, moist areas just inside the body's openings).\nWhen loss of sensation occurs, injuries (such as burns or fractures) may go unnoticed. You should always try to avoid injuries. However, if you experience loss of sensation due to leprosy (or another cause), you may not feel pain, which commonly warns you of harm to your body. So, extra caution is required to ensure your body is not injured. \nThe disease may cause symptoms, such as: \nSkin lesions that may be faded/discolored, than your normal skin tone. These lesions commonly have decreased sensation to touch, heat, or pain and do not heal after several weeks to months. Growths on the skin. Thick, stiff or dry skin. Severe pain. Numbness on affected areas of the skin. Muscle weakness or paralysis (especially in the hands and feet). Eye problems that may lead to blindness.

It is not very contagious (difficult to transmit) and has a long incubation period (time before symptoms appear), which makes it difficult to determine where or when the disease was contracted. Children are more susceptible than adults to contracting the disease.\nLeprosy has two common forms, tuberculoid and lepromatous, and these have been further subdivided. Despite this classification, both forms produce sores on the skin, but the lepromatous form is most severe, producing large, disfiguring lumps and bumps (nodules). Also, forms of the disease eventually cause nerve damage in the arms and legs, which causes sensory loss in the skin and muscle weakness. People with long-term leprosy may lose the use of their hands or feet due to repeated injury resulting from lack of sensation.\nThe disease is common in many countries worldwide, and in temperate, tropical, and subtropical climates. Approximately 100 cases per year are diagnosed in the United States. Most cases are limited to the South, California, Hawaii, and U.S. island possessions. Today effective medications are available, and isolation of victims in \"leper colonies\" is unnecessary. The emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium leprae, as well as increased numbers of cases worldwide, has led to global concern about this disease.\nEvidence suggests that the bacteria that cause leprosy are able to spread from person to person. The transmission might happen when someone with the disease coughs or sneezes. This leads to the release of droplets into the air that carry the bacteria to another person. It might also happen if you are exposed to other nasal fluids (also known as secretions). Droplets and other body secretions can contain the bacteria that cause leprosy, thereby transmitting the infection."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Leprosy ?", "output": "Children are more susceptible than adults to contracting the disease.\nPeople who live in countries where the disease is widespread are at higher risk of contracting he disease.

However, as soon as patients start treatment, they are no longer able to spread the disease.\nYet, according to the CDC, most adults around the world might face very little risk of contracting leprosy, since evidence shows that 95% of all adults are naturally unable to get the disease, even if they\u2019ve been exposed to the bacteria that causes it. \nIn the southern areas of the United States some armadillos are infected with leprosy. Despite the low risk of contracting the disease from contact with an armadillo, it is possible. In case of contact with an armadillo, if you decide to see a doctor, make sure to provide a complete history of armadillo contact. Your doctor can determine whether or not you have the disease.

There are numerous reasons why the cure rate is not 100%. Some of Dr. Mohs data revealed a cure rate as low as 96%, but these were often very large tumor, and previously been treated by other modalities. Some authors claim that their 5 year cure rate for primary basal cell cancer exceeded 99% while other noted more conservative cure rate of 97%. The quoted cure rate for Mohs surgery on previously treated basal cell cancer is about 94%. \n1. Modern frozen section method. Frozen section histology does not give the added margin of safety by the cytotoxic Mohs paste,  originally used by Dr. Mohs. This paste might have destroyed any residual cancer cells not detected by the pathologist.\n2. Missing epidermal margins. Ideally, the Mohs section should include 100% of the epidermal margin, but greater than 95% is often accepted.  Unfortunately, vigorous scrubbing, poorly controlled initial curettage, poor tissue health, technician's error, and surgeon's error can introduce areas missing epithelial margin. Some surgeon consider 70% epithelial margin acceptable, while other suggests 100% margin. In the ideal situation, 100% of the epithelial margin should be available to be reviewed on serial sectioning of the Mohs specimen.\n3. Misreading of the pathology slide. It is difficult to differentiate between a small island of basal cell carcinoma and a hair follicle structure. Many Mohs surgeon limits their tissue processing to include only 2 sections of tissue.  This severely hampers their ability to determine if a structure is a hair follicle or a carcinoma. Two histologic sections can not fully distinguish these two nearly identical structures,  and can lead to either \"false negative\" or \"false positive\" errors by either calling a section clear of tumor, or calling a section positive for tumor, respectively. Serial sectioning of the tumor is preferred by other surgeons.  Surgeons who performs serial sectioning through the block of tissue (usually 100 micrometres apart) are assured the contiguous nature of his tumor, the distance of the tumor from the surgical margin, and is familiarized with the nature of the tumor. Serial sectioning also makes it easier to work with three dimensional tumor with difficult to compress margins.\n4. Compression artifact, freezing artifact, cautery artifact, tissue folds, crush artifact from forceps, relaxing incision artifact, cartilage dropping out, fat compression, poor staining, dropping of tumor, etc.  These can be introduced as the tumor is \"flattened\". Stain can run from the surgical edge, and stain the surgical margin - giving a false impression that the entire surgical margin is clear, when it is not. While some surgeon unfamiliar with the \"whole piece\" or \"PacMan\"  methods of processing might suggest that multiple piece sectioning is better than one. The more tissue sections are cut, the more artifacts in staining and tissue malformation will be introduced. It is imperative for the surgeon to be fully familiar with tissue handling and processing; and not simply relying on a trained technologist to perform his sectioning.\n5. Hard to see tumor in heavy inflammatory infiltrate.  This can occur with squamous cell carcinoma, especially when complicated with local infection, or intrinsic lymphoproliferative disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Because of abnormal peripheral blood profile, response to inflammatory skin conditions with patients with myelomonocytic leukemia can have appearance of atypical cells at sites of inflammation, confusing the Mohs surgeon. \n6. Perineural spread, and benign changes simulating perineural spread. Tumor spreading along a nerve can be difficult to visualize, and sometime benign plasma cells can surround the nerve, simulating cancer. \n7. Difficult to cut and process anatomical area.  Examples would be the ear, and other three dimensional structures like eyelids. The ability to make a scallop shaped incision is increasingly difficult when the surgical surface is no longer a flat plane, but is a three dimensional rigid structure.\n8. Recurrent skin cancer with multiple islands of recurrence. This can occur with either previous excision, or after electrodessication and curettage. As these residual skin cancer are often bound in scar tissue, and present in multiple location in the scar of the previous surgical defect - they are no longer contiguous in nature. Some surgeons advocate the removal of the complete scar in the treatment of \"recurrent\" skin cancers. Others advocate removing only the island of local recurrence, and leaving the previous surgical scar behind. The decision is often made depending on the location of the tumor, and the goal of the patient and physician.\n9. Unreported or underreported recurrence. Many patients simply will not return to the original surgeon to report a recurrence. Consulting surgeon on the repeat surgery will often not inform the first surgeon of the recurrence. The time it takes for a recurrent tumor to be visible to the patient might be 5 or more years. Quoted \"cure\" rates must be looked upon with the understanding that a 5 year cure rate might not necessary be correct. As basal cell carcinoma is a very slowly progressing tumor, a 5 year no recurrence rate might not be adequate. Longer follow up might be needed to detect a slow growing tumor left in the surgical scar.\n10. Poor training of the surgeon/pathologist/histotechnologist. While Mohs surgery is essentially a technical method of tissue handling and processing, the skill and training of the surgeon can greatly affect the outcome. The house of card is built with a foundation of good tissue handling, good surgical skill and hemostasis, and the bricks are the tissue processing and staining technique. A surgeon without a good histotechnologist is a house built with straw, and a histotechnologist without a good surgeon can not produce quality slides. While originally, surgeons learned the procedure by spending a few hours to several months with Dr. Mohs;  today, surgeons complete residency and fellowship spending hundreds of hours observing and doing Mohs surgery. It is highly encouraged that a physician interested in learning Mohs surgery should spend extended time observing, cutting, processing, and staining Mohs specimens. The histology block should be correctly mounted and cut the first time, as there is no second chances in Mohs histology. It is not a procedure that can be taught or learn in one weekend. Many residency and Mohs fellowship continue to teach the processing of only 2 Mohs sections per tumor. \nIrrespective of the problems associated with Mohs surgery, a true cure rate approaching 100% can occur with primary basal cell carcinoma (previously untreated) if proper respect of the physician's limitation, the procedure's limitation, and his laboratory staff's limitation. Conservative approach such as serial sectioning, good staining technique, and conservative Mohs margin (example: tumor at least 200 micrometre from the surgical margin) can assure the lowest recurrence rate."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the symptoms of Molluscum contagiosum?", "output": "Typically, the lesion of molluscum begins as a small, painless papule that may become raised up to a pearly, flesh-colored nodule. The papule often has a dimple in the center. These papules may occur in lines, where the person has scratched. Scratching or other irritation causes the virus to spread in a line or in groups, called crops. The papules are about 2 - 5 millimeters wide.

The different types of warts include:\nCommon warts usually appear on the hands, but can appear anywhere. Flat warts are generally found on the face and forehead. They are common in children, less common in teens, and rare in adults. Genital warts (condyloma) are usually found on the genitals, in the pubic area, and in the area between the thighs, but they can also appear inside the vagina and anal canal. Plantar warts are found on the soles of the feet. Subungual and periungual warts appear under and around the fingernails or toenails. Abnormally dark or light skin surrounding the lesion Numerous small, smooth, flat (pinhead sized) lesions on forehead, cheeks, arms, or legs Rough growths around or under fingernails or toenails Rough, round, or oval lesions on soles of feet -- flat to slightly raised -- painful to pressure Small, hard, flat or raised skin lesion or lump"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What causes Warts?", "output": "The typical wart is a raised round or oval growth on the skin with a rough surface. Compared with the surrounding normal skin, warts may appear light, dark, or black (rare). Most adults are familiar with the look of a typical wart and have little trouble recognizing it. Unusual warts with smooth surfaces or flat warts in children may be more difficult for parents to recognize. Common warts tend to cause no discomfort unless they are in areas of repeated friction or pressure. Plantar warts, for example, can become extremely painful. Large numbers of plantar warts on the foot may cause difficulty walking or running. Some warts will disappear without treatment, although it can sometimes take a couple of years.

Rodents, such as rats, carry the disease. It is spread by their fleas.\nThe plague bacteria can be transmitted to humans by the following ways:\nFlea bites\nPlague bacteria are most often transmitted by the bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics, many rodents die, causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. People and animals that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague are at risk of being infected from flea bites. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. Flea bite exposure may result in primary bubonic plague or septicemic plague.\nContact with contaminated fluids or tissues\nHumans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague - infected animal.\nInfectious droplets\nWhen a person has plague pneumonia, they may cough droplets containing the plague bacteria into the air. If these bacteria -containing droplets are breathed in by another person, they can cause pneumonic plague. Typically this requires direct and close contact with the person with pneumonic plague. Transmission of these droplets is the only way that plague can spread between people.\nThis type of spread has not been documented in the United States since 1924, but still occurs with some frequency in developing countries. Cats are particularly susceptible to plague and can be infected by eating infected rodents. Sick cats pose a risk of transmitting infectious plague droplets to their owners or to veterinarians. Several cases of human plague have occurred in the United States in recent decades as a result of contact with infected cats.\nIn the Middle Ages in Europe, massive plague epidemics killed millions of people. Plague can still be found in Africa, Asia, and South America. Today, plague is rare in the United States, but it has been known to occur in parts of California, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico.\nThe three most common forms of plague are:\nBubonic plague -- an infection of the lymph nodes Pneumonic plague -- an infection of the lungs Septicemic plague -- an infection of the blood\nThe time between infection and development of symptoms is typically 2 to 7 days, but may be as short as 1 day for pneumonic plague.

The pituitary produces several important hormones that control body functions such as growth and development, reproduction, and metabolism. But hormones never seem to act simply and directly. They usually \u201ccascade\u201d or flow in a series, affecting each other\u2019s production or release into the bloodstream. GH is part of a cascade of hormones that, as the name implies, regulates the physical growth of the body. This cascade begins in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus makes hormones that regulate the pituitary. One of the hormones in the GH series, or \u201caxis,\u201d is growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce GH. Secretion of GH by the pituitary into the bloodstream stimulates the liver to produce another hormone called insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). IGF-I is what actually causes tissue growth in the body. High levels of IGF-I, in turn, signal the pituitary to reduce GH production. The hypothalamus makes another hormone called somatostatin, which inhibits GH production and release. Normally, GHRH, somatostatin, GH, and IGF-I levels in the body are tightly regulated by each other and by sleep, exercise, stress, food intake, and blood sugar levels. If the pituitary continues to make GH independent of the normal regulatory mechanisms, the level of IGF-I continues to rise, leading to bone overgrowth and organ enlargement. High levels of IGF-I also cause changes in glucose (sugar) and lipid (fat) metabolism and can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\nIn more than 95 percent of people with acromegaly, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called an adenoma, produces excess GH. Pituitary tumors are labeled either micro- or macro-adenomas, depending on their size. Most GH-secreting tumors are macro-adenomas, meaning they are larger than 1 centimeter. Depending on their location, these larger tumors may compress surrounding brain structures. For example, a tumor growing upward may affect the optic chiasm\u2014where the optic nerves cross\u2014leading to visual problems and vision loss. If the tumor grows to the side, it may enter an area of the brain called the cavernous sinus where there are many nerves, potentially damaging them. Compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones. These hormonal shifts can lead to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and erectile dysfunction in men. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the thyroid\u2014another hormone-producing gland\u2014then thyroid hormones may decrease. Too little thyroid hormone can cause weight gain, fatigue, and hair and skin changes. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the adrenal gland, the hormone cortisol may decrease. Too little cortisol can cause weight loss, dizziness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and nausea. Some GH-secreting tumors may also secrete too much of other pituitary hormones. For example, they may produce prolactin, the hormone that stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk. Rarely, adenomas may produce thyroid-stimulating hormone. Doctors should assess all pituitary hormones in people with acromegaly. Rates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor vary greatly among people with adenomas. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of GH excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow more rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the venous sinuses, which are located near the pituitary gland. Younger patients tend to have more aggressive tumors. Regardless of size, these tumors are always benign. Most pituitary tumors develop spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. They are the result of a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell, which leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change, or mutation, is not present at birth, but happens later in life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells. It permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete GH. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and GH oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research.\nRarely, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors but by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and other parts of the brain. These tumors also lead to excess GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce GHRH, the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. When these non-pituitary tumors are surgically removed, GH levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve.\nIn patients with GHRH-producing, non-pituitary tumors, the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor.

The problem may be due to a disorder of the adrenal glands themselves (primary adrenal insufficiency) or to inadequate secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland (secondary adrenal insufficiency).\nAddison's disease affects about 1 in 100,000 people. Most cases are caused by the gradual destruction of the adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, by the body's own immune system. About 70 percent of reported cases of Addison's disease are caused by autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system makes antibodies that attack the body's own tissues or organs and slowly destroy them. Adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. As a result, often both glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldostertone) hormones are lacking. Sometimes only the adrenal gland is affected, as in idiopathic adrenal insufficiency; sometimes other glands also are affected, as in the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome.\nThe polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into two separate forms, referred to as type I and type II. Type I occurs in children, and adrenal insufficiency may be accompanied by:\nUnderactive parathyroid glands Slow sexual development Pernicious anemia Chronic Candida infections Chronic active hepatitis Hair loss (in very rare cases)\nType II, often called Schmidt's syndrome, usually afflicts young adults. Features of type II may include:\nAn underactive thyroid gland Slow sexual development Diabetes Vitiligo Loss of pigment on areas of the skin\nScientists think that the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is inherited because frequently more than one family member tends to have one or more endocrine deficiencies.\nTuberculosis (TB), an infection which can destroy the adrenal glands, accounts for about 20 percent of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency in developed countries. When adrenal insufficiency was first identified by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849, TB was found at autopsy in 70 to 90 percent of cases. As the treatment for TB improved, however, the incidence of adrenal insufficiency due to TB of the adrenal glands has greatly decreased.\nLess common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency are\nChronic infection, mainly fungal infections Cancer cells spreading from other parts of the body to the adrenal glands Amyloidosis Surgical removal of the adrenal glands\nThis form of adrenal insufficiency is much more common than primary adrenal insufficiency and can be traced to a lack of ACTH. Without ACTH to stimulate the adrenals, the adrenal glands' production of cortisol drops, but not aldosterone. A temporary form of secondary adrenal insufficiency may occur when a person who has been receiving a glucocorticoid hormone such as prednisone for a long time abruptly stops or interrupts taking the medication. Glucocorticoid hormones, which are often used to treat inflammatory illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, or ulcerative colitis, block the release of both corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and ACTH. Normally, CRH instructs the pituitary gland to release ACTH. If CRH levels drop, the pituitary is not stimulated to release ACTH, and the adrenals then fail to secrete sufficient levels of cortisol. Another cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is the surgical removal of benign, or noncancerous, ACTH-producing tumors of the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease). In this case, the source of ACTH is suddenly removed, and replacement hormone must be taken until normal ACTH and cortisol production resumes. Less commonly, adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland either decreases in size or stops producing ACTH. These events can result from:\nTumors or infections of the area Loss of blood flow to the pituitary Radiation for the treatment of pituitary tumors Surgical removal of parts of the hypothalamus Surgical removal of the pituitary gland"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "When to seek urgent medical care when I have Addison%27s disease ?", "output": "It is important to seek medical care if you show signs of any of the symptoms associated with Addison's disease.

This eye, through lack of use, gradually loses its ability to function.\nThe second primary cause of amblyopia is significantly unequal refractive power in the two eyes. For example, one eye may be very farsighted or nearsighted while the other eye may have normal vision.

In most people, the damage occurs in the left temporal lobe, although it can result from damage to the right lobe as well. People with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia may speak in long sentences that have no meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create made-up words. For example, someone with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia may say, \u201cYou know that smoodle pinkered and that I want to get him round and take care of him like you want before.\u201d As a result, it is often difficult to follow what the person is trying to say. People with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia usually have great difficulty understanding speech, and they are often unaware of their mistakes. These individuals usually have no body weakness because their brain injury is not near the parts of the brain that control movement.\n2. Broca\u2019s aphasia: A type of non-fluent aphasia is Broca\u2019s aphasia. People with Broca\u2019s aphasia have damage to the frontal lobe of the brain. They frequently speak in short phrases that make sense but are produced with great effort. They often omit small words such as \u201cis,\u201d \u201cand,\u201d and \u201cthe.\u201d For example, a person with Broca\u2019s aphasia may say, \u201cWalk dog,\u201d meaning, \u201cI will take the dog for a walk,\u201d or \u201cbook book two table,\u201d for \u201cThere are two books on the table.\u201d People with Broca\u2019s aphasia typically understand the speech of others fairly well. Because of this, they are often aware of their difficulties and can become easily frustrated. People with Broca\u2019s aphasia often have right-sided weakness or paralysis of the arm and leg because the frontal lobe is also important for motor movements.\n3.

For young children (around 10 years old) the recovery takes three weeks.\nThe real possibility of life-threatening peritonitis is the reason why acute appendicitis warrants speedy evaluation and treatment. The patient may have to undergo a medical evacuation. Appendectomies have occasionally been performed in emergency conditions (i.e. outside of a proper hospital), when a timely medical evaluation was impossible.\nTypical acute appendicitis responds quickly to appendectomy and occasionally will resolve spontaneously. If appendicitis resolves spontaneously, it remains controversial whether an elective interval appendectomy should be performed to prevent a recurrent episode of appendicitis. Atypical appendicitis (associated with suppurative appendicitis) is more difficult to diagnose and is more apt to be complicated even when operated early.

However, avian influenza is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, very sick and kill them.\nHuman infection with avian influenza viruses: There are many different subtypes of type A influenza viruses. Usually, \u201cavian influenza virus \u201d refers to influenza A viruses found chiefly in birds, but infections with these viruses can occur in humans. The risk from avian influenza is generally low to most people, because the viruses do not usually infect humans. However, confirmed cases of human infection from several subtypes of avian influenza infection have been reported since 1997. Most cases of avian influenza infection in humans have resulted from contact with infected poultry (e.g., domesticated chicken, ducks, and turkeys) or surfaces contaminated with secretion / excretions from infected birds. The spread of avian influenza viruses from one ill person to another has been reported very rarely, and has been limited, inefficient and unsustained.\n\u201cHuman influenza virus \u201d usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. There are only three known A subtypes of influenza viruses (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) currently circulating among humans.

Back pain may occur by itself, or along with other symptoms. Back pain is categorized into acute pain and chronic pain.\nPain that hits you suddenly\u2014after falling from a ladder, being tackled on the football field, or lifting a load that is too heavy, for example\u2014is acute pain. Acute pain comes on quickly and often leaves just as quickly. To be classified as acute, pain should last no longer than 6 weeks. Acute pain is the most common type of back pain.\nChronic pain, on the other hand, may come on either quickly or slowly, and it lingers a long time. In general, pain that lasts longer than 3 months is considered chronic. Chronic pain is much less common than acute pain."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What causes Back pain?", "output": "Medical problems that can cause back pain include the following:\nMechanical problems: A mechanical problem is a problem with the way your spine moves or the way you feel when you move your spine in certain ways. Perhaps the most common mechanical cause of back pain is a condition called intervertebral disk degeneration (such as degenerative disk disease), which simply means that the disks located between the vertebrae of the spine are breaking down with age. As they deteriorate, they lose their cushioning ability. This problem can lead to pain if the back is stressed. Other mechanical causes of back pain include spasms, muscle tension, and ruptured disks, which are also called herniated disks.\nInjuries: Spine injuries such as sprains and fractures can cause either short-lived or chronic pain. Sprains are tears in the ligaments that support the spine, and they can occur from twisting or lifting improperly. Fractured vertebrae are often the result of osteoporosis. Less commonly, back pain may be caused by more severe injuries that result from accidents or falls.\nAcquired conditions and diseases: Many medical problems can cause or contribute to back pain. They include: Scoliosis, a curvature of the spine that does not usually cause pain until middle age Spondylolisthesis Various forms of arthritis, including: Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Ankylosing spondylitis Spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal column that puts pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Kidney stones or kidney infections Endometriosis, which is the buildup of uterine tissue in places outside the uterus. Fibromyalgia, a condition of widespread muscle pain and fatigue.\nAdditionally, although osteoporosis itself is not painful, it can lead to painful fractures of the vertebrae. Pregnancy is also a common cause of back pain.\nInfections and tumors: Although they are not common causes of back pain, infections can cause pain when they involve the vertebrae, a condition called osteomyelitis, or when they involve the disks that cushion the vertebrae, which is called diskitis. Tumors also are relatively rare causes of back pain.\nEmotional: Although the causes of back pain are usually physical, emotional stress can play a role in how severe pain is and how long it lasts. Stress can affect the body in many ways, including causing back muscles to become tense and painful."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Back pain ?", "output": "Although anyone can have back pain, a number of factors increase your risk. They include:\nAge: The first attack of low back pain typically occurs between the ages of 30 and 40. Back pain becomes more common with age.\nFitness level: Back pain is more common among people who are not physically fit. Weak back and abdominal muscles may not properly support the spine. \u201cWeekend warriors\u201d\u2014people who go out and exercise a lot after being inactive all week\u2014are more likely to suffer painful back injuries than people who make moderate physical activity a daily habit. Studies show that low-impact aerobic exercise is good for the disks that cushion the vertebrae, the individual bones that make up the spine.\nDiet: A diet high in calories and fat, combined with an inactive lifestyle, can lead to obesity, which can put stress on the back.\nHeredity: Some causes of back pain, such as ankylosing spondylitis, a form of arthritis that affects the spine, have a genetic component.\nRace: Race can be a factor in back problems. African American women, for example, are two to three times more likely than white women to develop spondylolisthesis, a condition in which a vertebra of the lower spine\u2014 also called the lumbar spine\u2014 slips out of place.\nThe presence of other diseases: Many diseases can cause or contribute to back pain. These include various forms of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers elsewhere in the body that may spread to the spine.\nOccupational risk factors: Having a job that requires heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling, particularly when this involves twisting or vibrating the spine, can lead to injury and back pain. An inactive job or a desk job may also lead to or contribute to pain, especially if you have poor posture or sit all day in an uncomfortable chair.\nCigarette smoking: Although smoking may not directly cause back pain, it increases your risk of developing low back pain and low back pain with sciatica. For example, smoking may lead to pain by blocking your body\u2019s ability to deliver nutrients to the disks of the lower back. Repeated coughing due to heavy smoking may also cause back pain. It is also possible that smokers are just less physically fit or less healthy than nonsmokers, which increases the likelihood that they will develop back pain. Smoking also increases the risk of osteoporosis, a condition that causes weak, porous bones, which can lead to painful fractures of the vertebrae.

Osteosarcoma occurs more frequently in people who have had high-dose external radiation therapy or treatment with certain anticancer drugs; children seem to be particularly susceptible. A small number of bone cancers are due to heredity. For example, children who have had hereditary retinoblastoma (an uncommon cancer of the eye) are at a higher risk of developing osteosarcoma, particularly if they are treated with radiation. Additionally, people who have hereditary defects of bones and people with metal implants, which doctors sometimes use to repair fractures, are more likely to develop osteosarcoma (4).

The attacks are unpredictable and strike \"out of the blue\" with a feeling like an iron grip around the rib cage. The colloquial names for the disease, such as'The Devil's grip' reflect this symptom.\nOnce inside the body, the coxsackie viruses multiply in the throat and intestines then spread into the bloodstream. At this point, the body's immune defenses often can limit the infection and prevent the person from developing symptoms. If the immune defenses are less successful, the person develops a fever or other symptoms, such as headache, nausea and vomiting, and sore throat. Only a few infected people develop the classic muscle pain in the chest and upper abdomen that gives the disease its name. In these people, the coxsackie virus infection has settled in the muscles of the chest and upper abdomen, causing inflammation there. The chest pain usually feels worse with deep breathing, called pleuritic pain. It can be a severe, stabbing pain or it can be a milder cramping in the side. Usually, only one side of the chest or abdomen is affected, although occasionally the pain can include muscles of the neck or arms.

Doctors often cannot explain why one woman develops breast cancer and another does not. They do know that bumping, bruising, or touching the breast does not cause cancer. And breast cancer is not contagious. You cannot \"catch\" it from another person.\nResearch has shown that women with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop breast cancer. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of developing a disease.\nAge: The chance of getting breast cancer goes up as a woman gets older. Most cases of breast cancer occur in women over 60. This disease is not common before menopause.\nPersonal history of breast cancer: A woman who had breast cancer in one breast has an increased risk of getting cancer in her other breast.\nFamily history: A woman's risk of breast cancer is higher if her mother, sister, or daughter had breast cancer. The risk is higher if her family member got breast cancer before age 40. Having other relatives with breast cancer (in either her mother's or father's family) may also increase a woman's risk.\nCertain breast changes: Some women have cells in the breast that look abnormal under a microscope. Having certain types of abnormal cells (atypical hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS) increases the risk of breast cancer.\nGene changes: Changes in certain genes increase the risk of breast cancer. These genes include BRCA1, BRCA2, and others. Tests can sometimes show the presence of specific gene changes in families with many women who have had breast cancer. Health care providers may suggest ways to try to reduce the risk of breast cancer, or to improve the detection of this disease in women who have these changes in their genes. NCI offers publications on gene testing.\nReproductive and menstrual history: The older a woman is when she has her first child, the greater her chance of breast cancer. Women who had their first menstrual period before age 12 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who went through menopause after age 55 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who never had children are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Women who take menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin after menopause also appear to have an increased risk of breast cancer. Large, well-designed studies have shown no link between abortion or miscarriage and breast cancer.\nRace: Breast cancer is diagnosed more often in white women than Latina, Asian, or African American women.\nRadiation therapy to the chest: Women who had radiation therapy to the chest (including breasts) before age 30 are at an increased risk of breast cancer. This includes women treated with radiation for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Studies show that the younger a woman was when she received radiation treatment, the higher her risk of breast cancer later in life.\nBreast density: Breast tissue may be dense or fatty. Older women whose mammograms (breast x-rays) show more dense tissue are at increased risk of breast cancer.\nTaking DES (diethylstilbestrol): DES was given to some pregnant women in the United States between about 1940 and 1971. (It is no longer given to pregnant women.) Women who took DES during pregnancy may have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. The possible effects on their daughters are under study.\nBeing overweight or obese after menopause: The chance of getting breast cancer after menopause is higher in women who are overweight or obese.\nLack of physical activity: Women who are physically inactive throughout life may have an increased risk of breast cancer. Being active may help reduce risk by preventing weight gain and obesity.\nDrinking alcohol: Studies suggest that the more alcohol a woman drinks, the greater her risk of breast cancer."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "When to seek urgent medical care when I have Breast cancer ?", "output": "See your health care provider about a breast change when you have:\nA lump in or near your breast or under your arm Thick or firm tissue in or near your breast or under your arm Nipple discharge or tenderness A nipple pulled back (inverted) into the breast Itching or skin changes such as redness, scales, dimples, or puckers A change in breast size or shape"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What to expect if I have Breast cancer  (Outlook/Prognosis)?", "output": "Survival rates for Breast Cancer\n80.4% of women with breast cancer survive after 5 years in the US 1983-90 (SEER) Breast cancer survival rates by stage of disease:\n100% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected before it starts to spread in the US (The American Cancer Society) 98% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected while it is smaller than 2cm in diameter and hasn\u2019t spread in the US (The American Cancer Society) 88% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected while it is 2-5cm in diameter and has spread to axillary lymph nodes in the US (The American Cancer Society) 76% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected even over 5cm in diameter if it hasn\u2019t spread to axillary lymph nodes in the US (The American Cancer Society) 76% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected while it is 2-5cm in diameter and has spread to axillary lymph nodes in the US (The American Cancer Society) 56% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected after it has spread to axillary lymph nodes and to axillary tissues in the US (The American Cancer Society) 49% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected after it has attached itself to the chest wall and chest lymph nodes in the US (The American Cancer Society) 16% of women survive breast cancer if it is detected after it has spread to other parts of the body such as bone, lung or liver in the US (The American Cancer Society)"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What causes Breast lumps?", "output": "Lumps in a woman are often caused by fibrocystic changes, fibroadenomas, and cysts.\nFibrocystic changes are painful, lumpy breasts.

HPV infection and other risk factors may act together to increase the risk even more:\nHPV Infection:\nHPV is a group of viruses that can infect the cervix. An HPV infection that doesn't go away can cause cervical cancer in some women. HPV is the cause of nearly all cervical cancers. These viruses are passed from person to person through sexual contact or skin to skin contact.\nMost adults have been infected with HPV at some time in their lives, but most infections clear up on their own. Some types of HPV can cause changes to cells in the cervix. If these changes are found early, cervical cancer can be prevented by removing or killing the changed cells before they can become cancer cells. A vaccine for females ages 9 to 26 protects against two types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer.\nLack of Regular Pap Test:\nCervical cancer is more common among women who don't have regular Pap test s. The Pap test helps doctors find abnormal cells. Removing or killing abnormal cells usually prevents cervical cancer.\nSmoking:\nAmong women who are infected with HPV, smoking cigarettes slightly increases the risk of cervical cancer.\nWeakened Immune System:\nInfection with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) or taking drugs that suppress the immune system increases the risk of cervical cancer.\nSexual History:\nWomen who have had many sexual partners have a higher risk of developing cervical cancer. Also, a woman who has had sex with a man who has had many sexual partners may be at higher risk of developing cervical cancer. In both cases, the risk of developing cervical cancer is higher because these women have a higher risk of HPV infection.\nUsing Birth Control Pills for a Long Time:\nUsing birth control pills for a long time (5 or more years) may slightly increase the risk of cervical cancer among women with HPV infection. However, the risk decreases quickly when women stop using birth control pills.\nHaving Many Children:\nStudies suggest that giving birth to many children (5 or more) may slightly increase the risk of cervical cancer among women with HPV infection.\nDES (diethylstilbestrol):\nDES may increase the risk of a rare form of cervical cancer in daughters exposed to this drug before birth. DES was given to some pregnant women in the United States between about 1940 and 1971.

The Pap test is one of the most reliable and effective cancer screening tests available, it also can find other conditions that might need treatment, such as infection or inflammation. In addition to the Pap test; the main test for cervical cancer, the HPV test may be used for screening women aged 30 years and older, or women of any age who have unclear Pap test results. If you are 30 or older, and your screening tests are normal, your chance of getting cervical cancer in the next few years is very low. For that reason, your doctor may tell you that you will not need another screening test for up to three years. But you should still go to the doctor regularly for a check-up that may include a pelvic exam.

You need the right amount of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy. However, you may not feel like eating during or soon after treatment. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, the side effects of treatment (such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, or mouth sores) can make it hard to eat well. Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another health care provider can suggest ways to cope with these problems. Research shows that people with cancer feel better when they stay active. Walking, yoga, swimming, and other activities can keep you strong and increase your energy. Exercise may reduce nausea and pain and make treatment easier to handle. It also can help relieve stress. Whatever physical activity you choose, be sure to talk to your doctor before you start. You'll need regular checkups after treatment for cervical cancer. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed. If you have any health problems with checkups, you should contact your doctor. Your doctor will check for the return of cancer. Even when cancer seems to have been completely removed or destroyed, the disease sometimes returns because undetected cancer cells remained somewhere in the body after treatment.

The reason males are at a greater risk of inheriting an X linked mutation is because males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome being significantly shorter than the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if a woman inherits a normal X chromosome in addition to the one which carries the mutation, she will not display the mutation. Men do not have a second X chromosome to override the chromosome which carries the mutation. If 5% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 5%, but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.05 \u00d7 0.05 = 0.0025, or just 0.25%.\nIn addition to those who are genetically predisposed to color blindness, people who suffer from brain or retinal damage, or who take the drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), are at an increased risk of color blindness."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "When to seek urgent medical care when I have Color blindness ?", "output": "Color blindness is not considered a medical emergency.\nHowever, make an appointment with your optometrist or ophthalmologist if you think you (or your child) have color blindness."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What to expect if I have Color blindness  (Outlook/Prognosis)?", "output": "Color blindness is a life-long condition.

Viral conjunctivitis: Viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract, a common cold, and/or a sore throat. Its symptoms include watery discharge and variable itch. The infection usually begins with one eye, but may spread easily to the other. Viral conjunctivitis is commonly known as \"pink eye.\" Bacterial conjunctivitis: Bacterial conjunctivitis due to the common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, grey or yellowish mucopurulent discharge (mucus, gowl, goop, gunk, eye crust, or other regional names, officially known as' gound') that may cause the lids to stick together (matting), especially after sleeping. Another symptom that could be caused by bacterial conjunctivitis is severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin. However, discharge is not essential to the diagnosis, contrary to popular belief. Bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Moraxella can cause a non-exudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness. The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye. The more acute pyogenic infections can be painful. Like viral conjunctivitis, it usually affects only one eye but may spread easily to the other eye. However, it is dormant in the eye for three days before the patient shows signs of symptoms.

Many people develop Cushing\u2019s syndrome because they take glucocorticoids\u2014steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisol\u2014such as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue. Other people develop Cushing\u2019s syndrome because their bodies produce too much cortisol. Normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. First, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland. CRH causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the ACTH, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.\nThese benign, or noncancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra ACTH. Most people with the disorder have a single adenoma. This form of the syndrome, known as Cushing\u2019s disease, affects women five times more often than men.\nSome benign or, more often, cancerous tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce ACTH. This condition is known as ectopic ACTH syndrome. Lung tumors cause more than half of these cases, and men are affected three times more often than women.\nIn rare cases, an abnormality of the adrenal glands, most often an adrenal tumor, causes Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Adrenal tumors are four to five times more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is about 40. Most of these cases involve noncancerous tumors of adrenal tissue called adrenal adenomas, which release excess cortisol into the blood. Adrenocortical carcinomas\u2014adrenal cancers\u2014are the least common cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome. With adrenocortical carcinomas, cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens, a type of male hormone. Adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms.\nMost cases of Cushing\u2019s syndrome are not inherited. Rarely, however, Cushing\u2019s syndrome results from an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands. Endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream. With primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease, children or young adults develop small cortisol-producing tumors of the adrenal glands. With multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), hormone-secreting tumors of the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary develop; Cushing\u2019s syndrome in MEN1 may be due to pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal tumors."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the symptoms of Cyclothymia?", "output": "Episodes of hypomania and mild depression occur for at least 2 years (1 or more years in children and adolescents)\nMood swings are less severe than in bipolar disorder, major depression, or mania\nSymptoms are persistent, with no more than 2 symptom-free months in a row"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What causes Cyclothymia?", "output": "The causes of cyclothymic disorder are unknown.\nMajor depression, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia often occur together in families.

Damage to the pituitary gland can be caused by different diseases as well as by head injuries, neurosurgery, or genetic disorders. To treat the ADH deficiency that results from any kind of damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary, a synthetic hormone called desmopressin can be taken by an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids only when thirsty and not at other times. The drug prevents water excretion, and water can build up now that the kidneys are making less urine and are less responsive to changes in body fluids.\nNephrogenic DI results when the kidneys are unable to respond to ADH. The kidneys \u2019 ability to respond to ADH can be impaired by drugs \u2014like lithium, for example\u2014and by chronic disorders including polycystic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, kidney failure, partial blockage of the ureters, and inherited genetic disorders. Sometimes the cause of nephrogenic DI is never discovered. Desmopressin will not work for this form of DI. Instead, a person with nephrogenic DI may be given hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or indomethacin. HCTZ is sometimes combined with another drug called amiloride. The combination of HCTZ and amiloride is sold under the brand name Moduretic. Again, with this combination of drugs, one should drink fluids only when thirsty and not at other times.\nDipsogenic DI is caused by a defect in or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in an abnormal increase in thirst and fluid intake that suppresses ADH secretion and increases urine output. Desmopressin or other drugs should not be used to treat dipsogenic DI because they may decrease urine output but not thirst and fluid intake. This fluid overload can lead to water intoxication, a condition that lowers the concentration of sodium in the blood and can seriously damage the brain. Scientists have not yet found an effective treatment for dipsogenic DI.\nGestational DI occurs only during pregnancy and results when an enzyme made by the placenta destroys ADH in the mother. The placenta is the system of blood vessels and other tissue that develops with the fetus. The placenta allows exchange of nutrients and waste products between mother and fetus.Most cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Diabetes insipidus ?", "output": "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus presenting at or shortly after birth can have a genetic cause.

The blood then becomes much more concentrated than normal (hyperosmolarity).\nHyperosmolarity is a condition in which the blood has a high concentration of salt (sodium), glucose, and other substances that normally cause water to move into the bloodstream.

The disease is rare in Asia and Africa, where most people eat high-fiber diets.\nFiber is the part of fruits, vegetables, and grains that the body cannot digest. Some fiber, called soluble fiber, dissolves easily in water. It takes on a soft, jelly-like texture in the intestines. Insoluble fiber passes almost unchanged through the intestines. Both kinds of fiber help prevent constipation by making stools soft and easy to pass.\nConstipation \u2014or hard stool\u2014may cause people to strain when passing stool during a bowel movement. Straining may cause increased pressure in the colon, which may cause the colon lining to bulge out through weak spots in the colon wall. These bulges are diverticula.\nLack of exercise also may be associated with a greater risk of forming diverticula, although the reasons for this are not well understood.\nDoctors are not certain what causes diverticula to become inflamed.

Sound waves are sent toward the colon through a handheld device that a technician glides over the abdomen. The sound waves bounce off the colon and other organs, and their echoes make electrical impulses that create a picture\u2014called a sonogram \u2014on a video monitor. If the diverticula are inflamed, the sound waves will also bounce off of them and show the location. Computerized tomography (CT) scan. The CT scan is a noninvasive x ray that produces cross-section images of the body. The doctor may inject dye into a vein and the person may be given a similar mixture to swallow.

There are two types of dystonia: acquired dystonia and idiopathic dystonia.\nAcquired dystonia, also called secondary dystonia, results from environmental or disease-related damage to the basal ganglia. Birth injury (particularly due to lack of oxygen), certain infections, reactions to certain drugs, heavy-metal or carbon monoxide poisoning, trauma, or stroke can cause dystonic symptoms. Dystonias can also be symptoms of other diseases, some of which may be hereditary.\nAbout half the cases of dystonia have no connection to disease or injury and are called primary or idiopathic dystonia. Of the primary dystonias, many cases appear to be inherited in a dominant manner; i.e., only one carrier parent need contribute the dystonia gene for the disease to occur, each child having a 50% chance of being a carrier. In dystonia, however, a carrier may or may not develop a dystonia and the symptoms may vary widely even among members of the same family. The product of one defective gene appears to be sufficient to cause the chemical imbalances that may lead to dystonia; but the possibility exists that another gene or genes and environmental factors may play a role. Researchers have identified more than 15 different genetic mutations that may contribute to dystonia.\nWhether you have acquired or idiopathic dystonia, researchers think that it is caused by a problem in the part of the brain that handles messages about muscle contractions. Scientists suspect a defect in the body's ability to process a group of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help cells in the brain communicate with each other.\nThe ultimate goals of research are to find the cause(s) of the dystonias so that they can be prevented, and to find ways to cure and/or more effectively treat people now affected. Scientists at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) laboratories have conducted detailed investigations of the pattern of muscle activity in persons with focal dystonias. One of the most important characteristics is the failure of reciprocal inhibition, a normal process in which muscles with opposite actions work without opposing each other. In dystonia, the tightening of muscles is associated with an abnormal pattern of muscles fighting each other. The search for the gene or genes responsible for some forms of dominantly inherited dystonias continues."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Who is at highest risk for Dystonia ?", "output": "Different dystonias are caused by different factors.

A combination estrogen-progestin replacement therapy in post menopausal women, however, has not been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nBeginning to have menstrual periods at an early age also increases the number of years the body is exposed to estrogen and increases a woman's risk of endometrial cancer. Similarly, women who reach menopause at an older age are exposed to estrogen for a longer time and have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\nNever being pregnant is also a risk factor for endometrial cancer. Because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, women who have never been pregnant are exposed to estrogen for a longer time than women who have been pregnant. This increases the risk of endometrial cancer.\nTamoxifen\nTamoxifen is one of a group of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs. Tamoxifen is used to prevent breast cancer in women who are at high risk for the disease, but it increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This risk is greater in postmenopausal women.\nAnother drug in the SERM group, raloxifene, is used to prevent bone weakness in postmenopausal women and has not been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nInherited risk\nHereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome is an inherited disorder caused by changes in certain genes.

Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors are modifiable and some are nonmodifiable. Having the risk factor doesn't always mean that you will get the disease but it certainly increases your chances as compared to the general population.\nRisk factors for lymphoma are as under:\nAge Getting older is a strong risk factor for lymphoma overall, with most cases occurring in people in their 60s or older. But some types of lymphoma are more common in younger people. Gender Overall, the risk of NHL is higher in men than in women, but there are certain types of NHL that are more common in women. The reasons for this are not known. Race, Ethnicity, and Geography In the United States, whites are more likely than African Americans and Asian Americans to develop NHL. Worldwide, NHL is more common in developed countries, with the United States and Europe having some of the highest rates. Some types of lymphoma are linked to certain infections (described further on) that are more common in some parts of the world. Family history Having a first degree relative (parent, child, sibling) with NHL increases your risk of developing NHL.\nExposure to certain chemicals Some studies have suggested that chemicals such as benzene and certain herbicides and insecticides (weed- and insect-killing substances) may be linked to an increased risk of NHL. Research to clarify these possible links is still in progress. Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers may increase the risk of developing NHL many years later. For example, patients who have been treated for Hodgkin lymphoma have an increased risk of later developing NHL. But it\u2019s not totally clear if this is related to the disease itself or if it is an effect of the treatment. Some studies have suggested that certain drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as methotrexate and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, might increase the risk of NHL. But other studies have not found an increased risk. Determining if these drugs increase risk is complicated by the fact that people with RA, which is an autoimmune disease, already have a higher risk of NHL (see below). Radiation exposure Studies of survivors of atomic bombs and nuclear reactor accidents have shown they have an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including NHL, leukemia, and thyroid cancer. Patients treated with radiation therapy for some other cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, have a slightly increased risk of developing NHL later in life. This risk is greater for patients treated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\nAutoimmmune diseases Some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), Sjogren (Sj\u00f6gren) disease, celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), and others have been linked with an increased risk of NHL. Certain infections Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Helicobacter pylori Chlamydophila psittaci Campylobacter jejuni Hepatitis C Body Weight and Diet Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of NHL. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings. In any event, staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet have many known health benefits outside of the possible effect on lymphoma risk. Breast implants It is rare, but some women with breast implants develop a type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in their breast.

However, before reviewing them, a brief overview of the anatomy of the eye may be helpful in understanding the causes of this disease:\nThe front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is always being made in the back of the eye. It leaves the eye through channels in the front of the eye in an area called the anterior chamber angle, or simply the angle. Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid out of the eye will cause pressure to build up in the eye. This pressure is called intraocular pressure (IOP). In most cases of glaucoma, this pressure is high and causes damage to the major nerve in the eye, called the optic nerve.\nMore specific causes by each major type of glaucoma are:\nOpen-angle (chronic) glaucoma\nThe cause is unknown. An increase in eye pressure occurs slowly over time. The pressure pushes on the optic nerve and the retina at the back of the eye. Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are at particularly high risk for this disease.\nAngle-closure (acute) glaucoma\nIt occurs when the exit of the aqueous humor fluid is suddenly blocked. Dilating eye drops and certain medications may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.\nCongenital glaucoma'\nIt is present at birth and results from the abnormal development of the fluid outflow channels in the eye. It is often hereditary and tends to run in families.\nSecondary glaucoma\nIt is caused as complications of other medical conditions and/or procedures, including eye surgery, advanced cataracts, eye injuries, certain eye tumors, and uveitis. It can be caused by drugs such as corticosteroids, which are used to treat eye inflammations. Pigmentary glaucoma is caused when pigment from the iris breaks off, thereby slowing the fluid drainage and blocking the meshwork.

Eighty-five percent of head and neck cancers are linked to tobacco use. People who use both tobacco and alcohol are at greater risk for developing these cancers than people who use either tobacco or alcohol alone.\nOther risk factors for cancers of the head and neck include the following:\nOral cavity. Sun exposure (lip); possibly human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Salivary glands. Radiation to the head and neck. This exposure can come from diagnostic x-rays or from radiation therapy for noncancerous conditions or cancer. Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity.

Cure rates decrease in locally advanced cases, whose probability of cure is inversely related to tumor size and even more so to the extent of regional node involvement.\nConsensus panels in America (American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC and Europe) have established staging systems for head and neck squamous cancers. These staging systems attempt to standardize clinical trial criteria for research studies, and attempt to define prognostic categories of disease. Squamous cell cancers of the head and neck are staged according to the TNM classification system, where T is the size and configuration of the tumor, N is the presence or absence of lymph node metastases, and M is the presence or absence of distant metastases. The T, N, and M characteristics are combined to produce a \u201cstage\u201d of the cancer, from I to IVB. \nEven after successful definitive therapy, head and neck cancer patients face tremendous impacts on quality of life. Despite marked advances in reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and conservation approaches to certain malignancies, some patients continue to have significant functional deficits.\nSurvival advantages provided by new treatment modalities have been undermined by the significant percentage of patients cured of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who subsequently develop second primary tumors. The incidence of second primary tumors ranges in studies from 9.1%  to 23%  at 20 years. Second primary tumors are the major threat to long-term survival after successful therapy of early-stage HNSCC. Their high incidence results from the same carcinogenic exposure responsible for the initial primary process, called field cancerization.\nThroat cancer has numerous negative effects on the body systems.\nAs it can impair a person\u2019s ability to swallow and eat, throat cancer affects the digestive system. The difficulty in swallowing can lead to a person to choke on their food in the early stages of digestion and interfere with the food\u2019s smooth travels down into the esophagus and beyond.\nThe treatments for throat cancer can also be harmful to the digestive system as well as other body systems. Radiation therapy can lead to nausea and vomiting, which can deprive a body of vital fluids (although these may be obtained through intravenous fluids if necessary). Frequent vomiting can lead to an electrolyte imbalance which has serious consequences for the proper functioning of the heart. Frequent vomiting can also upset the balance of stomach acids which has a negative impact on the digestive system, especially the lining of the stomach and esophagus.\nIn the cases of some throat cancers, the air passages in the mouth and behind the nose may become blocked from lumps or the swelling from the open sores. If the throat cancer is near the bottom of the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the lungs and interfering with the person\u2019s ability to breathe; this is even more likely if the patient is a smoker, because they are highly susceptible to lung cancer. If the respiratory system is unable to bring oxygen into the body, the oxygen deprivation will cause the body's cells to wither and die, causing one to become weaker and sicker.\nLike any cancer, metastasization affects many areas of the body, as the cancer spreads from cell to cell and organ to organ. For example, if it spreads to the bone marrow, it will prevent the body from producing enough red blood cells and affects the proper functioning of the white blood cells and the body's immune system; spreading to the circulatory system will prevent oxygen from being transported to all the cells of the body; and throat cancer can throw the nervous system into chaos, making it unable to properly regulate and control the body."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What are the symptoms of HELLP syndrome?", "output": "Fatigue or feeling unwell Fluid retention and excess weight gain Headache Nausea and vomiting that continues to get worse Pain in the upper right part of the abdomen Blurry vision Nosebleed or other bleeding that won't stop easily (rare) Seizures or convulsions (rare)"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "What causes HELLP syndrome?", "output": "A cause for HELLP syndrome has not been found.\nHELLP syndrome occurs in about 1 to 2 out of 1,000 pregnancies, and in 10-20% of pregnant women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.\nMost often HELLP develops before the pregnancy is 37 weeks along.

Men and women have the same chance of inheriting two copies of this gene.\nNot everyone who is born with two copies of the mutated HFE gene develops the disease. Scientists do not know what percentage of people who have two copies of the mutated HFE gene develop the disease. Some studies have shown that as few as 1 in 100 people will develop symptoms. Other studies have shown that as many as 50 in 100 people may develop symptoms. A person with only one copy of the mutated HFE gene is usually healthy and is said to be a \u201ccarrier\u201d of the genetic condition.

Other factors that increase risk are:\nEthnic Background: White people of northern European descent (for example, families from England, Ireland, Scotland, Denmark, France, and Scandinavia) have a higher chance of having the HFE gene mutation. Family History: People with a close relative (grandparent, mother, father, sibling, niece, nephew) who has hemochromatosis have a higher chance of having the HFE gene mutation.\nThere are other factors which influence the rate at which iron is absorbed by the body:\nDietary supplements: Taking iron supplements or multivitamins with iron can speed up the rate at which iron builds up in the body. Persons with hemochromatosis should not take pills containing iron. Eating foods that contain iron is fine. Taking vitamin C supplements may cause the body to absorb more iron. Persons with hemochromatosis should not take pills with more than 500 milligrams of vitamin C per day. Eating foods that contain vitamin C is fine. Blood loss: Losing iron by giving blood and losing iron through menstruation and unrecognized bleeding may slow the start of hemochromatosis.
